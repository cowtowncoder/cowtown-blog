			<p><p>
      (Disclaimer: this article talks about <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson 
      JSON processor</a> -- not other Jacksons, like American cities or 
      presidents -- those others can be found from Wikipedia)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>0. Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that although it is almost six years since I released 
      the first public version of Jackson, I have not actually written much 
      about events surrounding Jackson development -- I have written about its 
      features, usage, and other important things. But not that much about how 
      it came about.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since still remember fairly well how things worked out, and have 
      secondary archives (like this blog, Maven/SVN/Github repositories) 
      available for fact-checking the timeline, it seems like high time to 
      write a short(ish) historical document on the most popular OSS project I 
      have authored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Beginning: first there was Streaming</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime in early 2007, I was working at Amazon.com, and had 
      successfully used XML as the underying data format for couple of web 
      services. This was partly due to having written <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxHome">Woodstox</a>, 
      a high-performance Java XML parser. I was actually relatively content 
      with the way things worked with XML, and had learnt to appreciate 
      benefits of open, standard, text-based data format (including 
      developer-debuggability, interoperability and -- when done properly -- 
      even simplicity).<br>But I had also been bitten a few times by XML 
      data-binding solutions like JAXB; and was frustrated both by 
      complexities of some tools, and by direction that XML-centric developers 
      were taking, focusing unnecessarily in the format (XML) itself, instead 
      of how to solve actual development problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I happened to read about JSON data format, I immediately saw 
      potential benefits: the main one being that since it was a <b>Data Format</b> 
      -- and not a (Textual) <b>Markup Format</b> (like XML) -- it should be 
      much easier to convert between JSON and (Java) objects. And if that was 
      simpler, perhaps tools could actually do more; offer more intuitive and 
      powerful functionality, instead of fighting with complex monsters like 
      XML Schema or (heaven forbid) lead devs to XSLT.<br>Other features of 
      JSON that were claimed as benefits, like slightly more compact size 
      (marginally so), or better readabilty (subjective) I didn't really 
      consider particularly impresive.<br>Beyond appreciating good fit of JSON 
      for web service use case, I figured that writing a simple streaming 
      tokenizer and generator should be easy: after all, I had spent lots of 
      time writing low-level components necessary for tokenizing content (I 
      started writing Woodstox in late 2003, around time Stax API was 
      finalized)
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out I was right: I got a streaming parser working and  in about 
      two weeks (and generator in less than a week). In a month I had things 
      working well enough that the library could be used for something. And 
      then it was ready to be released (&quot;release early, release often&quot;); and 
      rest is history, as they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason for writing Jackson, which I have occasionally mentioned, 
      was what I saw as a sorry state of JSON tools -- my personal pet peeve 
      was use of org.json's reference implementation. While it was fine as a 
      proof-of-concept, I consider(ed) it a toy library, too simplistic, 
      underpowered thing for &quot;real&quot; work. Other alternatives just seemed to 
      short-change one aspect or another: I was especially surprised to find 
      total lack of modularity (streaming vs higher levels) and scant support 
      for true data-binding -- solutions tended to either assume unusual 
      conventions or require lots of seemingly unnecessary code to be written. 
      If I am to write code, I'd rather do it via efficient streaming 
      interface; or if not, get a powerful and convenient data-binding. Not a 
      half-assed XML-influenced tree model, which was en vogue (and sadly, 
      often still is).
    </p>
    <p>
      And the last thing regarding ancient history: the name. I actually do 
      not remember story behind it -- obviously it is a play on JSON. And I 
      vaguely recall toying with the idea of calling library &quot;Jason&quot;, but 
      deciding that might sound too creepy (I knew a few Jasons, and didn't 
      want confusion). Compared to Woodstox -- where I actually remember that 
      my friend Kirk P gave the idea (related to Snoopy's friend, bird named 
      Woodstock!) -- I actually don't really know who to give credit to the 
      idea, or inspiration to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. With a FAST Streaming library...</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having written (and quickly published in <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2007/08/entry_45.html">August 
      2007</a>) streaming-only version of Jackson, I spent some time 
      optimizing and measuring things, as well as writing some code to see how 
      convenient library is to use. But my initial thinking was to wrap things 
      up relatively soon, and &quot;let Someone Else write the Important Pieces&quot;. 
      And by &quot;important pieces&quot; I mostly meant a data-binding layer; something 
      like what JAXB and XMLBeans are to XML Streaming components (SAX/Stax).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reasons for my hesitation were two-fold: I thought that
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        writing a data-binding library will be lots of work, even if JSON 
        lends itself much more easily to doing that; and
      </li>
      <li>
        to do binding efficiently, I would have to use code-generation; 
        Reflection API was &quot;known&quot; to be unbearably slow
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Turns out that I was 50% right: data-binding has consumed vast majority 
      of time I have spent with Jackson. But I was largely wrong with respect 
      to Reflection. But more on that in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short term (during summer and autumn of 2008) I did write &quot;simple&quot; 
      data-binding, to bind Java Lists and Maps to/from token streams; and I 
      also wrote a simple Tree Model, latter of which has been rewritten since 
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. ... but No One Built It, So I did</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson the library did get relatively high level of publicity from 
      early on. This was mostly due to my earlier work on Woodstox, and its 
      adoption by all major second-generation Java SOAP stacks (CXF nee XFire; 
      Axis 2). Given my reputation for producing fast parsers, generators, 
      there was interest in using what I had written for JSON. But early 
      adopters used things as is; and no one did (to my knowledge) try to 
      build higher-level abstractions that I eagerly wanted to be written.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that alone might not have been enough to push me to try my luck 
      writing data-binding. What was needed was a development that made me 
      irritated enough to dive in deep... and sure enough, something did 
      emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what was the trigger? It was the idea of using XML APIs to process 
      JSON (that is, use adapters to expose JSON content as if it was XML). 
      While most developers who wrote such tools consider this to be a 
      stop-gap solution to ease transition, many developers did not seem to 
      know this.<br>I thought (and still think) that this is an <b>OBVIOUSLY</b> 
      bad idea; and initially did not spend much time refuting merits of the 
      idea -- why bother, as anyone should see the problem? I assumed that any 
      sane Java developer would obviously see that &quot;Format Impedance&quot; -- 
      difference between JSON's Object (or Frame) structure and XML Hierarchic 
      model -- is a major obstacle, and would render use of JSON even MORE 
      CUMBERSOME than using XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I saw people suggesting use of tools like Jettison (JSON via 
      Stax API), even integrating this into otherwise good frameworks (JAX-RS 
      like Jersey). Madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that developers appeared intent ruining the good thing, I figured 
      I need to show the Better Way; just talking about that would not be 
      enough.<br>So, late in 2008, around time I moved on from Amazon, I 
      started working on a first-class Java/JSON data-binding solution. This 
      can be thought of as &quot;real&quot; start of Jackson as we know it today; bit 
      over one year after the first release.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Start data-binding by writing Serialization side</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Jackson version to contain real data-binding was 0.9.5, 
      released December of 2008. Realizing that this was going to be a big 
      undertaking, I first focused on simpler problem of serializing POJOs as 
      JSON (that is, taking values of Java objects, writing equivalent JSON 
      output).<br>Also, to make it likely that I actually complete the task, I 
      decided to simply use Reflection &quot;at first&quot;; performance should really 
      matter only once thing actually works. Besides, this way I would have 
      some idea as to magnitude of the overhead: having written a fair bit of 
      manual JSON handling code, it would be easy to compare performance of 
      hand-written, and fully automated data-binder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think serializer took about a month to work to some degree, and a week 
      or two to weed out bugs. The biggest surprise to me was that Reflection 
      overhead actually was NOT all that big -- it seemed to add maybe 30-40% 
      time; some of which might be due to other overhead beside Reflection 
      access (Reflection is just used for dynamically calling get-methods or 
      accessing field values). This was such a non-issue for the longest time, 
      that it took multiple years for me to go back to the idea of generating 
      accessor code (for curious, <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/04/entry_470.html">Afterburner 
      Module</a> is the extension that finally does this).
    </p>
    <p>
      My decision to start with Serialization (without considering the other 
      direction, deserialization) was good one for the project, I believe, but 
      it did have one longer-term downside: much of the code between two parts 
      was disjoint. Partly this was due to my then view that there are many 
      use cases where only one side is needed -- for example, Java service 
      only every writing JSON output, but not necessarily reading (simple 
      query parameters and URL path go a long way). But big part was that I 
      did not want to slow down writing of serialization by having to also 
      consider challenges in deserialization.<br>And finally, I had some bad 
      memories from JAXB, where requirements to have both getters AND setters 
      was occasionally a pain-in-the-buttocks, for write-only use cases. I did 
      not want to repeat mistakes of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the biggest practical result of almost complete isolation 
      between serialization and deserialization side was that sometimes 
      annotations needed to be added in multiple places; like indicating both 
      setter and getter what the JSON property name should be. Over time I 
      realized that this was not a good things; but the problem itself was 
      only resolved in Jackson 1.9, much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. And wrap it up with Deserialization</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After serialization (and resulting 0.9.5) release, I continued work with 
      deserialization, and perhaps surprisingly finished it slightly faster 
      than serialization. Or perhaps it is not that surprising; even without 
      working on deserialization concepts earlier, I had nonetheless tackled 
      many of issues I would need to solve, including that of using Reflection 
      efficiently and conveniently; and that of resolving generic types (which 
      is a hideously tricky problem in Java, as readers of my blog should <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/12/entry_126.html">know 
      by now</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Result of this was 0.9.6 release in January 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. And then on to Writing Documentation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After managing to get the first fully functional version of data-binding 
      available, I realized that the next blocker would be lack of 
      documentation. So far I had blogged occasionally about Jackson usage; 
      but for the most part I had relied on resourcefulness of the early 
      adopters, those hard-working hardy pioneers of development. But if 
      Jackson was to become the King of JSON on Java platform, I would need to 
      do more for it users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking blog at my blog archive I can see that some of the most 
      important and most read articles on the site are from January of 2009. 
      Beyond the obvious introductions to various operating modes (like &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_137.html">Method 
      2, Data Binding</a>&quot;), I am especially proud of &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_131.html">There 
      are Three Ways to Process Json!</a>&quot; -- an article that I think is still 
      relevant. And something I wish every Java JSON developer would read, 
      even if they didn't necessarily agree with all of it. I am surprised how 
      many developers blindly assume that one particular view -- often the 
      Tree Model -- is the only mode in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Trailing New Blazes: adding Advanced Features </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until version 1.0 (<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/05/entry_264.html">released 
      May 2009</a>), I don't consider my work to be particularly new or 
      innovative: I was using good ideas from past implementations and my 
      experience in building better parsers, generators, tree models and data 
      binders. Implementations were ahead of competition in both XML and JSON 
      space; but perhaps the only truly advanced thing was that of generic 
      type resolution, and even there, I had more to learn yet (eventually I 
      wrote <a href="https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-classmate">Java 
      ClassMate</a>, which I consider the first Java library to actually get 
      generic type resolution right -- more so than Jackson itself).
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of truly new, advanced (from my point of view) features was 
      mostly since there was so much to do, all the foundational code, 
      implementing all basic and intermediate things that were (or should have 
      been) expected from a Java data-binding library. I did have ideas, but 
      in many cases had postponed those until I felt I had time to spare on 
      &quot;nice-to-have&quot; things, or features that were more speculative and might 
      not even work; either functionally, or with respect to developers 
      finding them useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at this point, I figured I would have the luxury of aiming higher; 
      not just making a bit Better Mousetrap, but something that is... 
      Something Else altogether. And with following 1.x versions, I started 
      implementing things that I consider somewhat advanced, pushing the 
      envelope a bit. I could talk or write for hours on various features; 
      what follows is just a sampling. For slightly longer take, read my 
      earlier &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2010/11/entry_434.html">7 
      Killer Features of Jackson</a>&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.1 Support for JAXB annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With Jackson 1.1, I also started considering interoperability. And 
      although I thought that compatibility with XML is a Bad Idea, when done 
      at API level, I thought that certain aspects could be useful: 
      specifically, ability to use (a subset of) JAXB annotations for 
      customizing data-binding.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I did not think that JAXB annotations could suffice alone to cover 
      all configuration needs, I had to figure a way for JAXB and Jackson 
      annotations to co-exist. The result is concept of &quot;Annotation 
      Introspector&quot;, and it is something I am actually proud of: even if 
      supporting JAXB annotations has been lots of work, and caused various 
      frustrations (mostly as JAXB is XML-specific, and some concepts do not 
      translate well), I think the mechanism used for isolating annotation 
      access from rest of the code has worked very well. It is one area that I 
      managed to design right the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also worth mentioning that beyond ability to use alternative 
      &quot;annotation sets&quot;, Jackson's annotation handling logic has always been 
      relatively advanced: for example, whereas standard JDK annotation 
      handling does not support overriding (that is; annotations are not 
      &quot;inherited&quot; from overridden methods), Jackson supports inheritance of 
      Class, Method and even Constructor annotations. This has proven like a 
      good decision, even if implementing it for 1.0 was lots of work.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.2 Mix-in annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of challenges with Java Annotations is the fact that one has to be 
      able to modify classes that are annotated. Beyond requiring actual 
      access to sources, this can also add unnecessary and unwanted 
      dependencies from value classes to annotations; and in case of Jackson, 
      these dependencies are in wrong direction, from design perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if one could just loosely associate annotations, instead of 
      having to forcible add them in classes? This was the thought exercise I 
      had; and led to what I think was the first implementation in Java of &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/08/entry_305.html">mix-in 
      annotations</a>&quot;. I am happy that 4 years since introduction (they were 
      added in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease12">Jackson 1.2</a>), 
      mix-in annotations are one of most loved Jackson features; and something 
      that I still consider innovative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.3 Polymorphic type support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One feature that I was hoping to avoid (kind of similar, in that sense, 
      to data-binding itself) was support for one of core Object Serialization 
      concepts: that of type.<br>What I mean here is that given a single 
      static (declared) type, one will still be able to deserialize instances 
      of multiple types. The challenge is that when serializing things there 
      is no problem -- type is available from instance being serialized -- but 
      to deserialize properly, additional information is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple problems in trying to support this with JSON: 
      starting with obvious problem of JSON not having separation of data and 
      metadata (with XML, for example, it is easy to &quot;hide&quot; metadata as 
      attributes). But beyond this question, there are various alternatives 
      for type identifiers (logical name or physical Java class?), as well as 
      alternative inclusion mechanisms (additional property? What name? Or, 
      use wrapper Array or Object).
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent lots of time trying to figure out a system that would satisfy 
      all the constraints I put; keep things easy to use, simple, and yet 
      powerful and configurable enough.<br>It took multiple months to figure 
      it all out; but in the end I was satisfied with my design. Polymorphic 
      type handling was included in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease15">Jackson 
      1.5</a>; less than one year after release of 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.4 No more monkey code -- Mr Bean can implement your classes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all advanced features, this is my own personal favorite: and 
      something I had actually hoped to tackle even before 1.0 release.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full description, go ahead and read &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2011/08/entry_459.html">Mr 
      Bean aka Abstract Type Materialization</a>&quot;; but the basic idea is, once 
      again, simple: why is it that even if you can define interface of your 
      data type as a simple interface, you still need to write monkey to code 
      around it? Other languages have solutions there; and some later Java 
      Frameworks like Lombok have presented some alternatives. But I am still 
      not aware of a general-purpose Java library for doing what Mr Bean does 
      (NOTE: you CAN actually use Mr Bean outside of Jackson too!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bean was included in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease16">Jackson 
      1.6</a> -- which was a release FULL of good, innovative new stuff. The 
      reason it took such a long time for me to build was actually hesitation 
      -- it is the first time I used Java bytecode generation. But after 
      starting to write code I learnt that it was surprisingly easy to do; and 
      I just wished I had started earlier.<br>Part of simplicity was due to 
      the fact that literally the only thing to generate were accessors 
      (setters and/or getters): everything else is handled by Jackson, by 
      introspecting resulting class, without having to even know there is 
      anything special about dynamically generated implementation class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.5 Binary JSON (Smile format)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important milestone with Jackson 1.6 was introduction of a new 
      binary data format called <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormat">Smile</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smile was borne out of my frustration with all the hype surrounding 
      Google's protobuf format: there was tons of hyperbole caused by the fact 
      that Google was opening up the data format they were using internally. 
      Protobuf itself is a simple and very reasonable binary data format, 
      suitable for encoding datagrams used for RPC. I call it &quot;best of 80s 
      datagram technology&quot;; not as an insult, but as a nod to maturity of the 
      idea -- it is automating things that back in 80s (and perhaps earlier) 
      were hand-coded whenever data communication was needed. Nothing wrong in 
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my frustration had more to do with creeping aspects of pre-mature 
      optimization; and the myopic view that binary formats were the only way 
      to achieve acceptable performance for high-volume communication. I 
      maintain that this is not true for general case.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, there are valid benefits from proper use of efficient 
      binary encodings. And one approach that seemed attractive to me was that 
      of using <i>alternative physical encoding</i> for representing existing 
      logical data model. This idea is hardly new; and it had been 
      demonstrated with XML, with BNUX, Fast Infoset and other approaches (all 
      that predate later sad effort known as EXI). But so far this had not 
      been tried with JSON -- sure, there is BSON, but it is not 1-to-1 
      mappable to JSON (despite what its name suggest), it is just another odd 
      (and very verbose) binary format.<br>So I thought that I should be able 
      to come up with a decent binary serialization format for JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timing for this effort was rather good, as I had joined <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> 
      earlier that year, and had actual use case for Smile. At Ning Smile was 
      dynamically used for some high-volume systems, such as log aggregation 
      (think of systems like Kafka, Splunk). Smile turns out to work 
      particularly well when coupled with ultra-fast compression like LZF 
      (implemented at and for Ning as well!).
    </p>
    <p>
      And beyond Ning, I had the fortune of working with creative genius(es) 
      behind <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>; this 
      was a match made in heaven, as they were just looking for an efficient 
      binary format to complement their use of JSON as external data format.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what about the name? I think I need to credit mr. Sunny Gleason on 
      this; we brainstormed the idea, and it came about directly when we 
      considered what &quot;magic cookie&quot; (first 4 bytes used to identify format) 
      to use -- using a smiley seemed like a crazy enough idea to work. So 
      Smile encoded data literally &quot;Starts With a Smile!&quot; (check it out!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.6 Modularity via Jackson Modules</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One more major area of innovation with Jackson 1.x series was that of 
      introduction of &quot;Module&quot; concept in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease17">Jackson 
      1.7</a>. From design/architectural perspective, it is the most important 
      change during Jackson development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The background to modules was my realization that I neither can nor want 
      to be the person trying to provide Jackson support for all useful Java 
      libraries; for datatypes like Joda, or Collection types of Guava. But 
      neither should users be left on their own, to have to write handlers for 
      things that do not (and often, can not) work out of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if not me or users, who would do it? The answer of &quot;someone else&quot; 
      does not sound great, until you actually think about it a bit. While I 
      think that the ideal case is that the library maintainers (of Joda, 
      Guava, etc) would do it, I think that the most <b>likely</b> case is 
      that &quot;someone with an itch&quot; -- developer who happens to need JSON 
      serialization of, say, Joda datetime types -- is the person who can add 
      this support. The challenge, then, is that of co-operation: how could 
      this work be turned to something reusable, modular... something that 
      could essentially be released as a &quot;mini-library&quot; of its own?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where the simple interface known as Module comes in: it is 
      simply just a way to package necessary implementations of Jackson 
      handlers (serializers, deserializers, other components they rely on for 
      interfacing with Jackson), and to register them with Jackson, without 
      Jackson having any a priori knowledge of the extension in question. You 
      can think them of Jackson equivalent of plug-ins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>8. Jackson 2.x</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there were more 1.x releases after 1.6, all introducing 
      important and interesting new features, focus during those releases 
      started to move towards bigger challenges regarding development. It was 
      also challenging to try to keep things backwards-compatible, as some 
      earlier API design (and occasionally implementation) decisions proved to 
      be sub-optimal. With this in mind, I started thinking about possibility 
      of making bigger change, making a major, somewhat backwards-incompatible 
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of 2.0 started maturing at around time of releasing Jackson 
      1.8; and so version 1.9 was designed with upcoming &quot;bigger change&quot; in 
      mind. It turns out that future-proofing is hard, and I don't know how 
      much all the planning helped. But I am glad that I thought through 
      multiple possible scenarios regarding potential ways versioning could be 
      handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important decision -- and one I think I did get right -- was to 
      change the Java and Maven packages Jackson 2.x uses: it should be (and 
      is!) possible to have both Jackson 1.x and Jackson 2.x implementations 
      in classpath, without conflicts. I have to thank my friend Brian 
      McCallister for this insight -- he convinced me that this is the only 
      sane way to go. And he is right. The alternative of just using the same 
      package name is akin to playing Russian Roulette: things MIGHT work, or 
      might not work. But you are actually playing with code of other people; 
      and they can't really be sure whether it will work for them without 
      trying... and often find out too late if it doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      So although it is more work all around for cases where things would have 
      worked; it is definitely much, much less work and pain for cases where 
      you would have had problems with backwards compatibility. In fact, 
      amount of work is quite constant; and most changes are mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20Features">Jackson 2.0</a> 
      took its time to complete; and was released February 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9. Jackson goes XML, CSV, YAML... and more</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of biggest changes with Jackson 2.x has been the huge increase in 
      number of Modules. Many of these handle specific datatype libraries, 
      which is the original use case. Some modules implement new 
      functionality; Mr Bean, for example, which was introduced in 1.6 was 
      re-packaged as a Module in later releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of those Crazy Ideas (&quot;what if...&quot;) that I had somewhere during 
      1.x development was to consider possibility of supporting data formats 
      other than JSON.<br>It started with the obvious question of how to 
      support Smile format; but that was relatively trivial (although it did 
      need some changes to underlying system, to reduce deep coupling with 
      physical JSON content). Adding Smile support lead me to realize that the 
      only JSON-specific handling occurs at streaming API level: everything 
      above this level only deals with Token Streams. So what if... we simply 
      implemented alternative backends that can produce/consume token streams? 
      Wouldn't this allow data-binding to be used on data formats like YAML, 
      BSON and perhaps even XML?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out it can, indeed -- and at this point, Jackson supports half a 
      dozen data formats beyond JSON (see <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">here</a>); 
      and more will be added over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>10. What Next?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As of writing this entry I am working on Jackson 2.3; and list of 
      possible things to work on is as long as ever. Once upon a time (around 
      finalizing 1.0) I was under false impression that maybe I will be able 
      to wrap up work in a release or two, and move on. But given how many 
      feature-laden versions I have released since then, I no longer thing 
      that Jackson will be &quot;complete&quot; any time soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to write more about Jackson future ... in (near I hope) future. I 
      hope above gave you more perspective on &quot;where's Jackson been?&quot;; and 
      perhaps can hint at where it is going as well.
    </p>

<div class="entry" id="post-478">
			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 2.1 was released... quite a while ago :)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">

			<p><p>
      Ok, so I have not been an active blogger for a while. Like, since about 
      a year ago. I am hoping to catch up a bit, so let's start with 
      intermediate Jackson releases that have gone out the door since I last 
      wrote about Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Jackson 2.1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 2.1 was released almost a year ago, October 2012. After big bang 
      of 2.0 release -- what with all the crazy new features like Object Id 
      handling (for fully cyclic object graphs), 2.1 was expected to be more 
      minor release in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, that was not to be... instead, 2.1 packed an impressive set of 
      improvements of its own.<br>Focus was on general usability: improved 
      ergonomics, bit of performance improvements (for data-binding) and the 
      usual array of bug fixes that required bigger changes in internals (and 
      occasionally additional API) than what can be done in a patch release.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      For more complete handling of what exactly was added, you can check out 
      my <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/Presentation-Jackson-2.1-Overview">Jackson 
      2.1 Overview</a> presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a> 
      (thanks Tony and folks!). Note that links to this and other 
      presentations can be found from <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs">Jackson 
      Docs</a> github repo.<br>For full list of changes, check <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease21">2.1 
      Release Notes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here's a Reader's Digest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Shape-shifting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>@JsonFormat</i> annotation was added in Jackson 2.0, but was not used 
      by many datatypes. With 2.1, there are interesting (and back then, 
      experimental; but it is much more stable now!) new features to let you 
      change the &quot;shape&quot; (JSON Structure) of some of common Java datatypes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Serialize Enums as JSON Objects instead of Strings: useful for 
        serialization, but can not deserialize back (how would that work? 
        Enums are singletons)
      </li>
      <li>
        Collections (Sets, Lists) as JSON Objects (instead of arrays): useful 
        for custom Collections that add extra properties -- can also 
        deserialize, with proper use of @JsonCreator annotations (or custom 
        deserializer)
      </li>
      <li>
        POJOs as Arrays! Instead of having name/value pairs, you will get JSON 
        arrays where position indicates which property is being used (make 
        sure to use @JsonPropertyOrder annotation to define ordering!)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of these, the last option is probably the most interesting. It can make 
      JSON as compact as CSV; and in fact can compete with binary formats in 
      many cases, especially if values are mostly Strings.<br>A simple example 
      would be:
    </p>
    <pre>  @JsonFormat(shape=JsonFormat.Shape.ARRAY)
  @JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic=true)
  public class Point {
    public int x, y;
  }</pre>
    <p>
      which, when serialized, could look like:
    </p>
    <pre>  [ 1, 2]</pre>
    <p>
      instead of earlier
    </p>
    <pre>  { &quot;x&quot;:1, &quot;y&quot;:2 }</pre>
    <p>
      and obviously works for reading as well (that is, you can read such 
      tabular data back).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Chunked (partial) Binary Data reads, writes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When dealing with really large data, granularity of <i>JsonParser</i> 
      and <i>JsonGenerator</i> works well, except for case of long JSON 
      Strings; for example, ones that contain Base64-encoded data. Since these 
      values may be potentially very large, and since they are quite often 
      just stored on disk (or read from disk to send) -- and there is no 
      benefit from keeping the whole value in memory at all -- it makes sense 
      to offer some way to allow streaming for values, not just between values.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, JsonParser and JsonGenerator now do have methods that allow 
      one to read and write large binary data chunks without retaining more 
      than a limited amount of data in memory (one buffer-full, like 8 or 
      16kB) at any given point. Access is provided via <i>java.io.InputStream</i> 
      and <i>java.io.OutputStream</i>, with methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      JsonParser.readBinaryValue(OutputStream)<br>JsonGenerator.writeBinary(InputStream, 
      int expectedLength)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that while direction of arguments may look odd, it actually makes 
      sense when you try using it: you will provide handler for content (which 
      implements OutputStream), and source for content to write (InputStream).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Format auto-detection support for data-binding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another innovative new feature is ability to use already existing data 
      format auto-detection, without having to use Streaming API. Earlier 
      versions included support for <i>JsonParser</i> auto-detecting type of 
      input, for data formats that support this (some binary formats do not; I 
      consider this a flaw in such formats; of text formats, CSV does not): at 
      least JSON, XML, Smile and YAML support auto-detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      You enable support through <i>ObjectReader</i> for example like so:
    </p>
    <pre>  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  XmlMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper(); // XML is special: must start with its own mapper
  ObjectReader reader = mapper
    .reader(POJO.class) // for reading instances of POJO
    .withFormatDetection(new JsonFactory(), xmlMapper.getFactory(), new SmileFactory();</pre>
    <p>
      and then you can use resulting reader normally:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  User user = mapper.readValue(new File(&quot;input.raw&quot;), User.class);</pre>
    <p>
      and input that is in XML, JSON or Smile format will be property decoded, 
      and bound to resulting class. I personally use this to support 
      transparent usage of Smile (binary JSON) format as a pluggable 
      optimization over JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Much improved XML module</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although XML module has existed since earlier 1.x versions, 2.0 provided 
      first solid version. But it did not include support for one commonly 
      used JAXB feature: ability to use so-called &quot;unwrapped&quot; Lists. 2.1 fixes 
      this and fully supports both wrapped and unwrapped Lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond this feature, testing was significantly extended, and a few 
      specific bugs were fixed. As a result version 2.1 is the first version 
      that I can fully recommend as replacement for JAXB processing in 
      production environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Delegating serializer, deserializer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Final new feature is support for so-called delegating serializers and 
      deserializers. The basic idea is simple: instead of having to build 
      fully custom handlers you only need to implement converters that can 
      convert your custom types into something that Jackson can automatically 
      handle (supports out of the box).
    </p>
    <p>
      Details of this are included in <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/Presentation-Jackson-2.1-Overview">2.1 
      presentation</a>; most commonly you will just extend <i>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDelegatingDeserializer</i> 
      and <i>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.StdDelegatingSerializer</i>.
    </p></p>
