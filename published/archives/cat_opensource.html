      (Disclaimer: this article talks about <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson 
      JSON processor</a> -- not other Jacksons, like American cities or 
      presidents -- those others can be found from Wikipedia)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>0. Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that although it is almost six years since I released 
      the first public version of Jackson, I have not actually written much 
      about events surrounding Jackson development -- I have written about its 
      features, usage, and other important things. But not that much about how 
      it came about.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since still remember fairly well how things worked out, and have 
      secondary archives (like this blog, Maven/SVN/Github repositories) 
      available for fact-checking the timeline, it seems like high time to 
      write a short(ish) historical document on the most popular OSS project I 
      have authored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Beginning: first there was Streaming</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime in early 2007, I was working at Amazon.com, and had 
      successfully used XML as the underying data format for couple of web 
      services. This was partly due to having written <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/WoodstoxHome">Woodstox</a>, 
      a high-performance Java XML parser. I was actually relatively content 
      with the way things worked with XML, and had learnt to appreciate 
      benefits of open, standard, text-based data format (including 
      developer-debuggability, interoperability and -- when done properly -- 
      even simplicity).<br>But I had also been bitten a few times by XML 
      data-binding solutions like JAXB; and was frustrated both by 
      complexities of some tools, and by direction that XML-centric developers 
      were taking, focusing unnecessarily in the format (XML) itself, instead 
      of how to solve actual development problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when I happened to read about JSON data format, I immediately saw 
      potential benefits: the main one being that since it was a <b>Data Format</b> 
      -- and not a (Textual) <b>Markup Format</b> (like XML) -- it should be 
      much easier to convert between JSON and (Java) objects. And if that was 
      simpler, perhaps tools could actually do more; offer more intuitive and 
      powerful functionality, instead of fighting with complex monsters like 
      XML Schema or (heaven forbid) lead devs to XSLT.<br>Other features of 
      JSON that were claimed as benefits, like slightly more compact size 
      (marginally so), or better readabilty (subjective) I didn't really 
      consider particularly impresive.<br>Beyond appreciating good fit of JSON 
      for web service use case, I figured that writing a simple streaming 
      tokenizer and generator should be easy: after all, I had spent lots of 
      time writing low-level components necessary for tokenizing content (I 
      started writing Woodstox in late 2003, around time Stax API was 
      finalized)
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out I was right: I got a streaming parser working and in about two 
      weeks (and generator in less than a week). In a month I had things 
      working well enough that the library could be used for something. And 
      then it was ready to be released (&quot;release early, release often&quot;); and 
      rest is history, as they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason for writing Jackson, which I have occasionally mentioned, 
      was what I saw as a sorry state of JSON tools -- my personal pet peeve 
      was use of org.json's reference implementation. While it was fine as a 
      proof-of-concept, I consider(ed) it a toy library, too simplistic, 
      underpowered thing for &quot;real&quot; work. Other alternatives just seemed to 
      short-change one aspect or another: I was especially surprised to find 
      total lack of modularity (streaming vs higher levels) and scant support 
      for true data-binding -- solutions tended to either assume unusual 
      conventions or require lots of seemingly unnecessary code to be written. 
      If I am to write code, I'd rather do it via efficient streaming 
      interface; or if not, get a powerful and convenient data-binding. Not a 
      half-assed XML-influenced tree model, which was en vogue (and sadly, 
      often still is).
    </p>
    <p>
      And the last thing regarding ancient history: the name. I actually do 
      not remember story behind it -- obviously it is a play on JSON. And I 
      vaguely recall toying with the idea of calling library &quot;Jason&quot;, but 
      deciding that might sound too creepy (I knew a few Jasons, and didn't 
      want confusion). Compared to Woodstox -- where I actually remember that 
      my friend Kirk P gave the idea (related to Snoopy's friend, bird named 
      Woodstock!) -- I actually don't really know who to give credit to the 
      idea, or inspiration to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. With a FAST Streaming library...</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having written (and quickly published in <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2007/08/entry_45.html">August 
      2007</a>) streaming-only version of Jackson, I spent some time 
      optimizing and measuring things, as well as writing some code to see how 
      convenient library is to use. But my initial thinking was to wrap things 
      up relatively soon, and &quot;let Someone Else write the Important Pieces&quot;. 
      And by &quot;important pieces&quot; I mostly meant a data-binding layer; something 
      like what JAXB and XMLBeans are to XML Streaming components (SAX/Stax).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reasons for my hesitation were two-fold: I thought that
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        writing a data-binding library will be lots of work, even if JSON 
        lends itself much more easily to doing that; and
      </li>
      <li>
        to do binding efficiently, I would have to use code-generation; 
        Reflection API was &quot;known&quot; to be unbearably slow
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Turns out that I was 50% right: data-binding has consumed vast majority 
      of time I have spent with Jackson. But I was largely wrong with respect 
      to Reflection. But more on that in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short term (during summer and autumn of 2008) I did write &quot;simple&quot; 
      data-binding, to bind Java Lists and Maps to/from token streams; and I 
      also wrote a simple Tree Model, latter of which has been rewritten since 
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. ... but No One Built It, So I did</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson the library did get relatively high level of publicity from 
      early on. This was mostly due to my earlier work on Woodstox, and its 
      adoption by all major second-generation Java SOAP stacks (CXF nee XFire; 
      Axis 2). Given my reputation for producing fast parsers, generators, 
      there was interest in using what I had written for JSON. But early 
      adopters used things as is; and no one did (to my knowledge) try to 
      build higher-level abstractions that I eagerly wanted to be written.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that alone might not have been enough to push me to try my luck 
      writing data-binding. What was needed was a development that made me 
      irritated enough to dive in deep... and sure enough, something did 
      emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what was the trigger? It was the idea of using XML APIs to process 
      JSON (that is, use adapters to expose JSON content as if it was XML). 
      While most developers who wrote such tools consider this to be a 
      stop-gap solution to ease transition, many developers did not seem to 
      know this.<br>I thought (and still think) that this is an <b>OBVIOUSLY</b> 
      bad idea; and initially did not spend much time refuting merits of the 
      idea -- why bother, as anyone should see the problem? I assumed that any 
      sane Java developer would obviously see that &quot;Format Impedance&quot; -- 
      difference between JSON's Object (or Frame) structure and XML Hierarchic 
      model -- is a major obstacle, and would render use of JSON even MORE 
      CUMBERSOME than using XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I saw people suggesting use of tools like Jettison (JSON via 
      Stax API), even integrating this into otherwise good frameworks (JAX-RS 
      like Jersey). Madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that developers appeared intent ruining the good thing, I figured 
      I need to show the Better Way; just talking about that would not be 
      enough.<br>So, late in 2008, around time I moved on from Amazon, I 
      started working on a first-class Java/JSON data-binding solution. This 
      can be thought of as &quot;real&quot; start of Jackson as we know it today; bit 
      over one year after the first release.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Start data-binding by writing Serialization side</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Jackson version to contain real data-binding was 0.9.5, 
      released December of 2008. Realizing that this was going to be a big 
      undertaking, I first focused on simpler problem of serializing POJOs as 
      JSON (that is, taking values of Java objects, writing equivalent JSON 
      output).<br>Also, to make it likely that I actually complete the task, I 
      decided to simply use Reflection &quot;at first&quot;; performance should really 
      matter only once thing actually works. Besides, this way I would have 
      some idea as to magnitude of the overhead: having written a fair bit of 
      manual JSON handling code, it would be easy to compare performance of 
      hand-written, and fully automated data-binder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think serializer took about a month to work to some degree, and a week 
      or two to weed out bugs. The biggest surprise to me was that Reflection 
      overhead actually was NOT all that big -- it seemed to add maybe 30-40% 
      time; some of which might be due to other overhead beside Reflection 
      access (Reflection is just used for dynamically calling get-methods or 
      accessing field values). This was such a non-issue for the longest time, 
      that it took multiple years for me to go back to the idea of generating 
      accessor code (for curious, <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/04/entry_470.html">Afterburner 
      Module</a> is the extension that finally does this).
    </p>
    <p>
      My decision to start with Serialization (without considering the other 
      direction, deserialization) was good one for the project, I believe, but 
      it did have one longer-term downside: much of the code between two parts 
      was disjoint. Partly this was due to my then view that there are many 
      use cases where only one side is needed -- for example, Java service 
      only every writing JSON output, but not necessarily reading (simple 
      query parameters and URL path go a long way). But big part was that I 
      did not want to slow down writing of serialization by having to also 
      consider challenges in deserialization.<br>And finally, I had some bad 
      memories from JAXB, where requirements to have both getters AND setters 
      was occasionally a pain-in-the-buttocks, for write-only use cases. I did 
      not want to repeat mistakes of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the biggest practical result of almost complete isolation 
      between serialization and deserialization side was that sometimes 
      annotations needed to be added in multiple places; like indicating both 
      setter and getter what the JSON property name should be. Over time I 
      realized that this was not a good things; but the problem itself was 
      only resolved in Jackson 1.9, much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. And wrap it up with Deserialization</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After serialization (and resulting 0.9.5) release, I continued work with 
      deserialization, and perhaps surprisingly finished it slightly faster 
      than serialization. Or perhaps it is not that surprising; even without 
      working on deserialization concepts earlier, I had nonetheless tackled 
      many of issues I would need to solve, including that of using Reflection 
      efficiently and conveniently; and that of resolving generic types (which 
      is a hideously tricky problem in Java, as readers of my blog should <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/12/entry_126.html">know 
      by now</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Result of this was 0.9.6 release in January 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. And then on to Writing Documentation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After managing to get the first fully functional version of data-binding 
      available, I realized that the next blocker would be lack of 
      documentation. So far I had blogged occasionally about Jackson usage; 
      but for the most part I had relied on resourcefulness of the early 
      adopters, those hard-working hardy pioneers of development. But if 
      Jackson was to become the King of JSON on Java platform, I would need to 
      do more for it users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking blog at my blog archive I can see that some of the most 
      important and most read articles on the site are from January of 2009. 
      Beyond the obvious introductions to various operating modes (like &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_137.html">Method 
      2, Data Binding</a>&quot;), I am especially proud of &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_131.html">There 
      are Three Ways to Process Json!</a>&quot; -- an article that I think is still 
      relevant. And something I wish every Java JSON developer would read, 
      even if they didn't necessarily agree with all of it. I am surprised how 
      many developers blindly assume that one particular view -- often the 
      Tree Model -- is the only mode in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Trailblazing: finally getting to add Advanced Features </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until version 1.0 (<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/05/entry_264.html">released 
      May 2009</a>), I don't consider my work to be particularly new or 
      innovative: I was using good ideas from past implementations and my 
      experience in building better parsers, generators, tree models and data 
      binders. I felt Jackson was ahead of competition in both XML and JSON 
      space; but perhaps the only truly advanced thing was that of generic 
      type resolution, and even there, I had more to learn yet (eventually I 
      wrote <a href="https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-classmate">Java 
      ClassMate</a>, which I consider the first Java library to actually get 
      generic type resolution right -- more so than Jackson itself).
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of truly new, advanced (from my point of view) features was 
      mostly since there was so much to do, all the foundational code, 
      implementing all basic and intermediate things that were (or should have 
      been) expected from a Java data-binding library. I did have ideas, but 
      in many cases had postponed those until I felt I had time to spare on 
      &quot;nice-to-have&quot; things, or features that were more speculative and might 
      not even work; either functionally, or with respect to developers 
      finding them useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at this point, I figured I would have the luxury of aiming higher; 
      not just making a bit Better Mousetrap, but something that is... 
      Something Else altogether. And with following 1.x versions, I started 
      implementing things that I consider somewhat advanced, pushing the 
      envelope a bit. I could talk or write for hours on various features; 
      what follows is just a sampling. For slightly longer take, read my 
      earlier &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2010/11/entry_434.html">7 
      Killer Features of Jackson</a>&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.1 Support for JAXB annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With Jackson 1.1, I also started considering interoperability. And 
      although I thought that compatibility with XML is a Bad Idea, when done 
      at API level, I thought that certain aspects could be useful: 
      specifically, ability to use (a subset of) JAXB annotations for 
      customizing data-binding.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I did not think that JAXB annotations could suffice alone to cover 
      all configuration needs, I had to figure a way for JAXB and Jackson 
      annotations to co-exist. The result is concept of &quot;Annotation 
      Introspector&quot;, and it is something I am actually proud of: even if 
      supporting JAXB annotations has been lots of work, and caused various 
      frustrations (mostly as JAXB is XML-specific, and some concepts do not 
      translate well), I think the mechanism used for isolating annotation 
      access from rest of the code has worked very well. It is one area that I 
      managed to design right the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also worth mentioning that beyond ability to use alternative 
      &quot;annotation sets&quot;, Jackson's annotation handling logic has always been 
      relatively advanced: for example, whereas standard JDK annotation 
      handling does not support overriding (that is; annotations are not 
      &quot;inherited&quot; from overridden methods), Jackson supports inheritance of 
      Class, Method and even Constructor annotations. This has proven like a 
      good decision, even if implementing it for 1.0 was lots of work.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.2 Mix-in annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of challenges with Java Annotations is the fact that one has to be 
      able to modify classes that are annotated. Beyond requiring actual 
      access to sources, this can also add unnecessary and unwanted 
      dependencies from value classes to annotations; and in case of Jackson, 
      these dependencies are in wrong direction, from design perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if one could just loosely associate annotations, instead of 
      having to forcible add them in classes? This was the thought exercise I 
      had; and led to what I think was the first implementation in Java of &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/08/entry_305.html">mix-in 
      annotations</a>&quot;. I am happy that 4 years since introduction (they were 
      added in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease12">Jackson 1.2</a>), 
      mix-in annotations are one of most loved Jackson features; and something 
      that I still consider innovative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.3 Polymorphic type support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One feature that I was hoping to avoid having to implement (kind of 
      similar, in that sense, to data-binding itself) was support for one of 
      core Object Serialization concepts (but not necessarily data-binding 
      concept; data is not polymorphic, classes are): that of type metadata.<br>What 
      I mean here is that given a single static (declared) type, one will 
      still be able to deserialize instances of multiple types. The challenge 
      is that when serializing things there is no problem -- type is available 
      from instance being serialized -- but to deserialize properly, 
      additional information is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple problems in trying to support this with JSON: 
      starting with obvious problem of JSON not having separation of data and 
      metadata (with XML, for example, it is easy to &quot;hide&quot; metadata as 
      attributes). But beyond this question, there are various alternatives 
      for type identifiers (logical name or physical Java class?), as well as 
      alternative inclusion mechanisms (additional property? What name? Or, 
      use wrapper Array or Object).
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent lots of time trying to figure out a system that would satisfy 
      all the constraints I put; keep things easy to use, simple, and yet 
      powerful and configurable enough.<br>It took multiple months to figure 
      it all out; but in the end I was satisfied with my design. Polymorphic 
      type handling was included in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease15">Jackson 
      1.5</a>; less than one year after release of 1.0. And still most Java 
      JSON libraries have no support at all for polymorphic types: or at most 
      support fixed use of Java class name -- I know how much work it can be, 
      but at least one could learn from existing implementations (which is 
      more than I had)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.4 No more monkey code -- Mr Bean can implement your classes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the advanced features Jackson offers, this is my own personal 
      favorite: and something I had actually hoped to tackle even before 1.0 
      release.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full description, go ahead and read &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2011/08/entry_459.html">Mr 
      Bean aka Abstract Type Materialization</a>&quot;; but the basic idea is, once 
      again, simple: why is it that even if you can define interface of your 
      data type as a simple interface, you still need to write monkey to code 
      around it? Other languages have solutions there; and some later Java 
      Frameworks like Lombok have presented some alternatives. But I am still 
      not aware of a general-purpose Java library for doing what Mr Bean does 
      (NOTE: you CAN actually use Mr Bean outside of Jackson too!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bean was included in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease16">Jackson 
      1.6</a> -- which was a release FULL of good, innovative new stuff. The 
      reason it took such a long time for me to build was hesitation -- it is 
      the first time I used Java bytecode generation. But after starting to 
      write code I learnt that it was surprisingly easy to do; and I just 
      wished I had started earlier.<br>Part of simplicity was due to the fact 
      that literally the only thing to generate were accessors (setters and/or 
      getters): everything else is handled by Jackson, by introspecting 
      resulting class, without having to even know there is anything special 
      about dynamically generated implementation class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.5 Binary JSON (Smile format)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important milestone with Jackson 1.6 was introduction of a 
      (then-) new binary data format called <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormat">Smile</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smile was borne out of my frustration with all the hype surrounding 
      Google's protobuf format: there was tons of hyperbole caused by the fact 
      that Google was opening up the data format they were using internally. 
      Protobuf itself is a simple and very reasonable binary data format, 
      suitable for encoding datagrams used for RPC. I call it &quot;best of 80s 
      datagram technology&quot;; not as an insult, but as a nod to maturity of the 
      idea -- it is automating things that back in 80s (and perhaps earlier) 
      were hand-coded whenever data communication was needed. Nothing wrong in 
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my frustration had more to do with creeping aspects of pre-mature 
      optimization; and the myopic view that binary formats were the only way 
      to achieve acceptable performance for high-volume communication. I 
      maintain that this is not true for general case.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, there are valid benefits from proper use of efficient 
      binary encodings. And one approach that seemed attractive to me was that 
      of using <i>alternative physical encoding</i> for representing existing 
      logical data model. This idea is hardly new; and it had been 
      demonstrated with XML, with BNUX, Fast Infoset and other approaches (all 
      that predate later sad effort known as EXI). But so far this had not 
      been tried with JSON -- sure, there is BSON, but it is not 1-to-1 
      mappable to JSON (despite what its name suggest), it is just another odd 
      (and very verbose) binary format.<br>So I thought that I should be able 
      to come up with a decent binary serialization format for JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timing for this effort was rather good, as I had joined <a href="http://ning.com">Ning</a> 
      earlier that year, and had actual use case for Smile. At Ning Smile was 
      dynamically used for some high-volume systems, such as log aggregation 
      (think of systems like Kafka, Splunk). Smile turns out to work 
      particularly well when coupled with ultra-fast compression like LZF 
      (implemented at and for Ning as well!).
    </p>
    <p>
      And beyond Ning, I had the fortune of working with creative genius(es) 
      behind <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a>; this 
      was a match made in heaven, as they were just looking for an efficient 
      binary format to complement their use of JSON as external data format.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what about the name? I think I need to credit mr. Sunny Gleason on 
      this; we brainstormed the idea, and it came about directly when we 
      considered what &quot;magic cookie&quot; (first 4 bytes used to identify format) 
      to use -- using a smiley seemed like a crazy enough idea to work. So 
      Smile encoded data literally &quot;Starts With a Smile!&quot; (check it out!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.6 Modularity via Jackson Modules</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One more major area of innovation with Jackson 1.x series was that of 
      introduction of &quot;Module&quot; concept in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease17">Jackson 
      1.7</a>. From design/architectural perspective, it is the most important 
      change during Jackson development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The background to modules was my realization that I neither can nor want 
      to be the person trying to provide Jackson support for all useful Java 
      libraries; for datatypes like Joda, or Collection types of Guava. But 
      neither should users be left on their own, to have to write handlers for 
      things that do not (and often, can not) work out of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if not me or users, who would do it? The answer of &quot;someone else&quot; 
      does not sound great, until you actually think about it a bit. While I 
      think that the ideal case is that the library maintainers (of Joda, 
      Guava, etc) would do it, I think that the most <b>likely</b> case is 
      that &quot;someone with an itch&quot; -- developer who happens to need JSON 
      serialization of, say, Joda datetime types -- is the person who can add 
      this support. The challenge, then, is that of co-operation: how could 
      this work be turned to something reusable, modular... something that 
      could essentially be released as a &quot;mini-library&quot; of its own?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where the simple interface known as Module comes in: it is 
      simply just a way to package necessary implementations of Jackson 
      handlers (serializers, deserializers, other components they rely on for 
      interfacing with Jackson), and to register them with Jackson, without 
      Jackson having any a priori knowledge of the extension in question. You 
      can think them of Jackson equivalent of plug-ins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>8. Jackson 2.x</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there were more 1.x releases after 1.6, all introducing 
      important and interesting new features, focus during those releases 
      started to move towards bigger challenges regarding development. It was 
      also challenging to try to keep things backwards-compatible, as some 
      earlier API design (and occasionally implementation) decisions proved to 
      be sub-optimal. With this in mind, I started thinking about possibility 
      of making bigger change, making a major, somewhat backwards-incompatible 
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of 2.0 started maturing at around time of releasing Jackson 
      1.8; and so version 1.9 was designed with upcoming &quot;bigger change&quot; in 
      mind. It turns out that future-proofing is hard, and I don't know how 
      much all the planning helped. But I am glad that I thought through 
      multiple possible scenarios regarding potential ways versioning could be 
      handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important decision -- and one I think I did get right -- was to 
      change the Java and Maven packages Jackson 2.x uses: it should be (and 
      is!) possible to have both Jackson 1.x and Jackson 2.x implementations 
      in classpath, without conflicts. I have to thank my friend Brian 
      McCallister for this insight -- he convinced me that this is the only 
      sane way to go. And he is right. The alternative of just using the same 
      package name is akin to playing Russian Roulette: things MIGHT work, or 
      might not work. But you are actually playing with code of other people; 
      and they can't really be sure whether it will work for them without 
      trying... and often find out too late if it doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      So although it is more work all around for cases where things would have 
      worked; it is definitely much, much less work and pain for cases where 
      you would have had problems with backwards compatibility. In fact, 
      amount of work is quite constant; and most changes are mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20Features">Jackson 2.0</a> 
      took its time to complete; and was released February 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9. Jackson goes XML, CSV, YAML... and more</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of biggest changes with Jackson 2.x has been the huge increase in 
      number of Modules. Many of these handle specific datatype libraries, 
      which is the original use case. Some modules implement new 
      functionality; Mr Bean, for example, which was introduced in 1.6 was 
      re-packaged as a Module in later releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of those Crazy Ideas (&quot;what if...&quot;) that I had somewhere during 
      1.x development was to consider possibility of supporting data formats 
      other than JSON.<br>It started with the obvious question of how to 
      support Smile format; but that was relatively trivial (although it did 
      need some changes to underlying system, to reduce deep coupling with 
      physical JSON content). Adding Smile support lead me to realize that the 
      only JSON-specific handling occurs at streaming API level: everything 
      above this level only deals with Token Streams. So what if... we simply 
      implemented alternative backends that can produce/consume token streams? 
      Wouldn't this allow data-binding to be used on data formats like YAML, 
      BSON and perhaps even XML?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out it can, indeed -- and at this point, Jackson supports half a 
      dozen data formats beyond JSON (see <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">here</a>); 
      and more will be added over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>10. What Next?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As of writing this entry I am working on Jackson 2.3; and list of 
      possible things to work on is as long as ever. Once upon a time (around 
      finalizing 1.0) I was under false impression that maybe I will be able 
      to wrap up work in a release or two, and move on. But given how many 
      feature-laden versions I have released since then, I no longer thing 
      that Jackson will be &quot;complete&quot; any time soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to write more about Jackson future ... in (near I hope) future. I 
      hope above gave you more perspective on &quot;where's Jackson been?&quot;; and 
      perhaps can hint at where it is going as well.

<div class="entry" id="post-478">
     <h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 2.1 was released... quite a while ago :)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Ok, so I have not been an active blogger for a while. Like, since about 
      a year ago. I am hoping to catch up a bit, so let's start with 
      intermediate Jackson releases that have gone out the door since I last 
      wrote about Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Jackson 2.1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 2.1 was released almost a year ago, October 2012. After big bang 
      of 2.0 release -- what with all the crazy new features like Object Id 
      handling (for fully cyclic object graphs), 2.1 was expected to be more 
      minor release in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, that was not to be... instead, 2.1 packed an impressive set of 
      improvements of its own.<br>Focus was on general usability: improved 
      ergonomics, bit of performance improvements (for data-binding) and the 
      usual array of bug fixes that required bigger changes in internals (and 
      occasionally additional API) than what can be done in a patch release.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      For more complete handling of what exactly was added, you can check out 
      my <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/Presentation-Jackson-2.1-Overview">Jackson 
      2.1 Overview</a> presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a> 
      (thanks Tony and folks!). Note that links to this and other 
      presentations can be found from <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs">Jackson 
      Docs</a> github repo.<br>For full list of changes, check <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease21">2.1 
      Release Notes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here's a Reader's Digest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Shape-shifting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>@JsonFormat</i> annotation was added in Jackson 2.0, but was not used 
      by many datatypes. With 2.1, there are interesting (and back then, 
      experimental; but it is much more stable now!) new features to let you 
      change the &quot;shape&quot; (JSON Structure) of some of common Java datatypes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Serialize Enums as JSON Objects instead of Strings: useful for 
        serialization, but can not deserialize back (how would that work? 
        Enums are singletons)
      </li>
      <li>
        Collections (Sets, Lists) as JSON Objects (instead of arrays): useful 
        for custom Collections that add extra properties -- can also 
        deserialize, with proper use of @JsonCreator annotations (or custom 
        deserializer)
      </li>
      <li>
        POJOs as Arrays! Instead of having name/value pairs, you will get JSON 
        arrays where position indicates which property is being used (make 
        sure to use @JsonPropertyOrder annotation to define ordering!)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of these, the last option is probably the most interesting. It can make 
      JSON as compact as CSV; and in fact can compete with binary formats in 
      many cases, especially if values are mostly Strings.<br>A simple example 
      would be:
    </p>
    <pre>  @JsonFormat(shape=JsonFormat.Shape.ARRAY)
  @JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic=true)
  public class Point {
    public int x, y;
  }</pre>
    <p>
      which, when serialized, could look like:
    </p>
    <pre>  [ 1, 2]</pre>
    <p>
      instead of earlier
    </p>
    <pre>  { &quot;x&quot;:1, &quot;y&quot;:2 }</pre>
    <p>
      and obviously works for reading as well (that is, you can read such 
      tabular data back).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Chunked (partial) Binary Data reads, writes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When dealing with really large data, granularity of <i>JsonParser</i> 
      and <i>JsonGenerator</i> works well, except for case of long JSON 
      Strings; for example, ones that contain Base64-encoded data. Since these 
      values may be potentially very large, and since they are quite often 
      just stored on disk (or read from disk to send) -- and there is no 
      benefit from keeping the whole value in memory at all -- it makes sense 
      to offer some way to allow streaming for values, not just between values.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, JsonParser and JsonGenerator now do have methods that allow 
      one to read and write large binary data chunks without retaining more 
      than a limited amount of data in memory (one buffer-full, like 8 or 
      16kB) at any given point. Access is provided via <i>java.io.InputStream</i> 
      and <i>java.io.OutputStream</i>, with methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      JsonParser.readBinaryValue(OutputStream)<br>JsonGenerator.writeBinary(InputStream, 
      int expectedLength)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that while direction of arguments may look odd, it actually makes 
      sense when you try using it: you will provide handler for content (which 
      implements OutputStream), and source for content to write (InputStream).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Format auto-detection support for data-binding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another innovative new feature is ability to use already existing data 
      format auto-detection, without having to use Streaming API. Earlier 
      versions included support for <i>JsonParser</i> auto-detecting type of 
      input, for data formats that support this (some binary formats do not; I 
      consider this a flaw in such formats; of text formats, CSV does not): at 
      least JSON, XML, Smile and YAML support auto-detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      You enable support through <i>ObjectReader</i> for example like so:
    </p>
    <pre>  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  XmlMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper(); // XML is special: must start with its own mapper
  ObjectReader reader = mapper
    .reader(POJO.class) // for reading instances of POJO
    .withFormatDetection(new JsonFactory(), xmlMapper.getFactory(), new SmileFactory();</pre>
    <p>
      and then you can use resulting reader normally:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>  User user = mapper.readValue(new File(&quot;input.raw&quot;), User.class);</pre>
    <p>
      and input that is in XML, JSON or Smile format will be property decoded, 
      and bound to resulting class. I personally use this to support 
      transparent usage of Smile (binary JSON) format as a pluggable 
      optimization over JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Much improved XML module</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although XML module has existed since earlier 1.x versions, 2.0 provided 
      first solid version. But it did not include support for one commonly 
      used JAXB feature: ability to use so-called &quot;unwrapped&quot; Lists. 2.1 fixes 
      this and fully supports both wrapped and unwrapped Lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond this feature, testing was significantly extended, and a few 
      specific bugs were fixed. As a result version 2.1 is the first version 
      that I can fully recommend as replacement for JAXB processing in 
      production environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Delegating serializer, deserializer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Final new feature is support for so-called delegating serializers and 
      deserializers. The basic idea is simple: instead of having to build 
      fully custom handlers you only need to implement converters that can 
      convert your custom types into something that Jackson can automatically 
      handle (supports out of the box).
    </p>
    <p>
      Details of this are included in <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/Presentation-Jackson-2.1-Overview">2.1 
      presentation</a>; most commonly you will just extend <i>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDelegatingDeserializer</i> 
      and <i>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.StdDelegatingSerializer</i>.

     <h2 class="date-header">Thursday, May 24, 2012 </h2>
<div class="entry" id="post-475">
     <h3 class="entry-header">Doing actual non-blocking, incremental HTTP access with async-http-client</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      <a href="https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client">Async-http-client</a> 
      library, originally developed at Ning (by Jean-Francois, Tom, Brian and 
      maybe others and since then by quite a few others) has been around for a 
      while now.<br>Its main selling point is the claim for better scalability 
      compared to alternatives like <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">Jakarta 
      HTTP Client</a> (this is not the only selling points: its API also seems 
      more intuitive).
    </p>
    <p>
      But although library itself is capable of working well in non-blocking 
      mode, most examples (and probably most users) use it in plain old 
      blocking mode; or at most use Future to simply defer handling of 
      respoonses, but without handling content incrementally when it becomes 
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this lack of documentation is bit unfortunate just in itself, the 
      bigger problem is that most usage as done by sample code requires 
      reading the whole response in memory.<br>This may not be a big deal for 
      small responses, but in cases where response size is in megabytes, this 
      often becomes problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Blocking, fully in-memory usage</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual (and potentially problematic) usage pattern is something like:
    </p>
    <pre>  AsyncHttpClient asyncHttpClient = new AsyncHttpClient();
  Future&lt;Response&gt; f = asyncHttpClient.prepareGet(&quot;http://www.ning.com/ &quot;).execute();
  Response r = f.get();<br>  byte[] contents = r.getResponseBodyAsBytes();</pre>
    <p>
      which gets the whole response as a byte array; no surprises there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Use InputStream to avoid buffering the whole entity?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first obvious work around attempt is to have a look at Response 
      object, and notice that there is method &quot;<i>getResponseBodyAsStream()</i>&quot;. 
      This would seemingly allow one to read response, piece by piece, and 
      process it incrementally, by (for example) writing it to a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this method is just a facade, implemented like so:
    </p>
    <pre> public InputStream getResponseBodyAsStream() {<br>   return new ByteArrayInputStream(getResponseBodyAsBytes());<br> }</pre>
    <p>
      which actually is no more efficient than accessing the whole content as 
      a byte array. :-/
    </p>
    <p>
      (why is it implemented that way? Mostly because underlying non-blocking 
      I/O library, like Netty or Grizzly, provides content using &quot;push&quot; style 
      interface, which makes it very hard to support &quot;pull&quot; style abstractions 
      like java.io.InputStream -- so it is not really AHC's fault, but rather 
      a consequence of NIO/async style of I/O processing)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Go fully async</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So what can we do to actually process large response payloads (or large 
      PUT/POST request payloads, for that matter)?
    </p>
    <p>
      To do that, it is necessary to use following callback abstractions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To handle response payloads (for HTTP GETs), we need to implement <b><i>AsyncCompletionHandler</i></b> 
        interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        To handle PUT/POST request payloads, we need to implement <b><i>BodyGenerator</i></b> 
        (which is used for creating a Body instance, abstraction for feeding 
        content)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Let's have a look at what is needed for the first case.
    </p>
    <p>
      (note: there are existing default implementations for some of the pieces 
      -- but here I will show how to do it from ground up) 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. A simple download-a-file example</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with a simple case of downloading a large file into a file, 
      without keeping more than a small chunk in memory at any given time. 
      This can be done as follows:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public class SimpleFileHandler implements AsyncHandler&lt;File&gt;
{
 private File file;
 private final FileOutputStream out;
 private boolean failed = false;

 public SimpleFileHandler(File f) throws IOException {
  file = f;
  out = new FileOutputStream(f);
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onBodyPartReceived(HttpResponseBodyPart part)
   throws IOException
 {
  if (!failed) {
   part.writeTo(out);
  }
  return STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public File onCompleted() throws IOException {
  out.close();
  if (failed) {
   file.delete();
   return null;
  }
  return file;
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onHeadersReceived(HttpResponseHeaders h) {
  // nothing to check here as of yet
  return STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onStatusReceived(HttpResponseStatus status) {
  failed = (status.getStatusCode() != 200);
  return failed ?  STATE.ABORT : STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public void onThrowable(Throwable t) {
  failed = true;
 }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Voila. Code is not very brief (event-based code seldom is), and it could 
      use some more handling for error cases.<br>But it should at least show 
      the general processing flow -- nothing very complicated there, beyond 
      basic state machine style operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Booooring. Anything more complicated?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Downloading a large file is something useful, but while not a contriver 
      example, it is rather plain. So let's consider the case where we not 
      only want to download a piece of content, but also want uncompress it, 
      in one fell swoop. This serves as an example of additional processing we 
      may want to do, in incremental/streaming fashion -- as an alternative to 
      having to store an intermediate copy in a file, then uncompress to 
      another file.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before showing the code, however, it is necessary to explain why 
      this is bit tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, remember that we can't really use <i>InputStream</i>-based 
      processing here: all content we get is &quot;pushed&quot; to use (without our code 
      ever blocking with input); whereas InputStream would want to push 
      content itself, possibly blocking the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second: most decompressors present either InputStream-based abstraction, 
      or uncompress-the-whole-thing interface: neither works for us, since we 
      are getting incremental chunks; so to use either, we would first have to 
      buffer the whole content. Which is what we are trying to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it, however, <a href="https://github.com/ning/compress">Ning 
      Compress</a> package (version 0.9.4, specifically) just happens to have 
      a push-style uncompressor interface (aptly named as &quot;<b><i>com.ning.compress.Uncompressor</i></b>&quot;); 
      and two implementations:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        com.ning.compress.lzf.LZFUncompressor
      </li>
      <li>
        com.ning.compress.gzip.GZIPUncompressor (uses JDK native zlib under 
        the hood)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So why is that fortunate? Because interface they expose is push style:
    </p>
    <pre> public abstract class Uncompressor
 {
  public abstract void feedCompressedData(byte[] comp, int offset, int len) throws IOException;
  public abstract void complete() throws IOException;<br> }</pre>
    <p>
      and is thereby usable to our needs here. Especially when we use 
      additional class called &quot;UncompressorOutputStream&quot;, which makes an 
      OutputStream out of Uncompressor and target stream (which is needed for 
      efficient access to content AHC exposes via <i>HttpResponseBodyPart</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Show me the code</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here goes:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public class UncompressingFileHandler implements AsyncHandler&lt;File&gt;,
   DataHandler // for Uncompressor
{
 private File file;
 private final OutputStream out;
 private boolean failed = false;
 private final UncompressorOutputStream uncompressingStream;

 public UncompressingFileHandler(File f) throws IOException {
  file = f;
  out = new FileOutputStream(f);
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onBodyPartReceived(HttpResponseBodyPart part)
   throws IOException
 {
  if (!failed) {
   // if compressed, pass through uncompressing stream
   if (uncompressingStream != null) {
    part.writeTo(uncompressingStream);
   } else { // otherwise write directly
    part.writeTo(out);
   }
   part.writeTo(out);
  }
  return STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public File onCompleted() throws IOException {
  out.close();
  if (uncompressingStream != null) {
   uncompressingStream.close();
  }
  if (failed) {
   file.delete();
   return null;
  }
  return file;
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onHeadersReceived(HttpResponseHeaders h) {
  // must verify that we are getting compressed stuff here:
  String compression = h.getHeaders().getFirstValue(&quot;Content-Encoding&quot;);
  if (compression != null) {
   if (&quot;lzf&quot;.equals(compression)) {
    uncompressingStream = new UncompressorOutputStream(new LZFUncompressor(this));
   } else if (&quot;gzip&quot;.equals(compression)) {
    uncompressingStream = new UncompressorOutputStream(new GZIPUncompressor(this));
   }
  }
  // nothing to check here as of yet
  return STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public com.ning.http.client.AsyncHandler.STATE onStatusReceived(HttpResponseStatus status) {
  failed = (status.getStatusCode() != 200);
  return failed ?  STATE.ABORT : STATE.CONTINUE;
 }

 public void onThrowable(Throwable t) {
  failed = true;
 }

 // DataHandler implementation for Uncompressor; called with uncompressed content:
 public void handleData(byte[] buffer, int offset, int len) throws IOException {
  out.write(buffer, offset, len);
 }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Handling gets bit more complicated here, since we have to handle both 
      case where content is compressed; and case where it is not (since server 
      is ultimately responsible for applying compression or not).
    </p>
    <p>
      And to make call, you also need to indicate capability to accept 
      compressed data. For example, we could define a helper method like:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public File download(String url) throws Exception
{
 AsyncHttpClient ahc = new AsyncHttpClient();
 Request req = ahc.prepareGet(url)
  .addHeader(&quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;, &quot;lzf,gzip&quot;)
  .build();
 ListenableFuture&lt;File&gt; futurama = ahc.executeRequest(req,<br>   new UncompressingFileHandler(new File(&quot;download.txt&quot;)));

 try { // wait for 30 seconds to complete
  return futurama.get(30, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 } catch (TimeoutException e) {
  throw new IOException(&quot;Failed to download due to timeout&quot;);
 }
}  <br></pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      which would use handler defined above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Easy enough?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope above shows that while doing incremental, &quot;streaming&quot; processing 
      is bit more work, it is not super difficult to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even when you have bit of pipelining to do, like uncompressing (or 
      compressing) data on the fly.
    </p></p>

               <p><p>
      Note: as useful earlier articles, consider reading &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/03/entry_468.html">Jackson

      2.0: now with XML, too!</a>&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Inspiration</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before jumping into the actual beef -- the new module -- I want to 
      mention my inspiration for this extension: the Greatest New Thing to hit 
      Java World Since JAX-RS called <a href="https://github.com/codahale/dropwizard">DropWizard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who have not yet tried it out and are unaware of its Kung-Fu 
      Panda like Awesomeness, please go and check it out. You won't be 
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      DropWizard is a sort of mini-framework that combines great Java 
      libraries (I may be biased, as it does use Jackson), starting with 
      trusty JAX-RS/Jetty8 combination, building with Jackson for JSON, jDBI 
      for DB/JDBC/SQL, Java Validation API (impl from Hibernate project) for 
      data validation, and logback for logging; adding bit of Jersey-client 
      for client-building and optional FreeMarker plug-in for UI, all bundled 
      up in a nice, modular and easily understandable packet.<br>Most 
      importantly, it &quot;Just Works&quot; and comes with intuitive configuration and 
      bootstrapping system. It also builds easily into a single deployable jar 
      file that contains all the code you need, with just a bit of Maven 
      setup; all of which is well documented. Oh, and the documentation is 
      very accessible, accurate and up-to-date. All in all, a very rare 
      combination of things -- and something that would give RoR and other 
      &quot;easier than Java&quot; frameworks good run for their money, if hipsters ever 
      decided to check out the best that Java has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most relevant part here is the configuration system. Configuration 
      can use either basic JSON or full YAML. And as I <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/04/entry_473.html">mentioned 
      earlier</a>, I am beginning to appreciate YAML for configuring things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1.1. The Specific inspirational nugget: YAML converter</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The way DropWizard uses YAML is to parse it using SnakeYAML library, 
      then convert resulting document into JSON tree and then using Jackson 
      for data binding. This is useful since it allows one to use full power 
      of Jackson configuration including annotations and polymorphic type 
      handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this got me thinking -- given that the whole converter 
      implementation about dozen lines or so (to work to degree needed for 
      configs), wouldn't it make sense to add &quot;full support&quot; for YAML into 
      Jackson family of plug-ins?
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. And Then There Was One More Backend for Jackson</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out that implementation was, indeed, quite easy. I was able to 
      improve certain things -- for example, module can use lower level API to 
      keep performance bit better; and output side also works, not just reader 
      -- but in a way, there isn't all that much to do since all module has to 
      do is to convert YAML events into JSON events, and maybe help with some 
      conversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of more advanced things include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Format auto-detection works, thanks to &quot;---&quot; document prefix (that 
        generator also produces by default)
      </li>
      <li>
        Although YAML itself exposes all scalars as text (unless type hints 
        are enabled, which adds more noise in content), module uses heuristics 
        to make parser implementation bit more natural; so although 
        data-binding can also coerce types, this should usually not be needed
      </li>
      <li>
        Configuration includes settings to change output style, to allow use 
        of more aesthetically pleasing output (for those who prefer &quot;wiki 
        look&quot;, for example)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At this point, functionality has been tested with a broad if shallow set 
      of unit tests; but because data-binding used is 100% same as with JSON, 
      testing is actually sufficient to use module for some work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Usage? So boring I tell you</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh. And you might be interested in knowing how to use the module. This 
      is the boring part, since.... there isn't really much to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You just use &quot;YAMLFactory&quot; wherever you would normally use 
      &quot;JsonFactory&quot;; and then under the hood you get &quot;YAMLParser&quot; and 
      &quot;YAMLGenerator&quot; instances, instead of JSON equivalents. And then you 
      either use parser/generator directly, or, more commonly, construct an 
      &quot;ObjectMapper&quot; with &quot;YAMLFactory&quot; like so (code snippet itself is from 
      test &quot;SimpleParseTest.java&quot;)
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(new YAMLFactory());<br>  User user = mapper.readValue(&quot;firstName: Billy\n&quot;<br>    +&quot;lastName: Baggins\n&quot;<br>    +&quot;gender: MALE\n&quot;<br>    +&quot;userImage: AQIDBAY=&quot;,<br>   User.class);</pre>
    <p>
      <hr>
      and to get the functionality itself, Maven dependency is:<hr>
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-dataformat-yaml&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      <b>4. That's all Folks -- until you give us some Feedback!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it for now. I hope some of you will try out this new backend, and 
      help us further make Jackson 2.0 the &quot;Universal Java Data Processor&quot;

     <h3 class="entry-header">Java Type Erasure not a Total Loss -- use Java Classmate for resolving generic signatures</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      As I have written before (&quot;<a href="/blog/archives/2010/12/entry_436.html">Why 
      'java.lang.reflect.Type' Just Does Not Cut It</a>&quot;), Java's Type Erasure 
      can be a royal PITA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things are actually not quite as bleak as one might think. But let's 
      start with an actual somewhat unsolvable problem; and then proceed with 
      another important, similar, yet solvable problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Actual Unsolvable problem: Java.util Collections</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is piece of code that illustrates a problem that most Java 
      developers either understand, or think they understand:
    </p>
    <pre>  List&lt;String,Integer&gt; stringsToInts = new ArrayList&lt;String,Integer&gt;();<br>  List&lt;byte[],Boolean&gt; bytesToBools = new ArrayList&lt;byte[], Boolean&gt;();<br>  assertSame(stringsToInts.getclass(), bytesToBools.getClass();</pre>
    <p>
      The problem is that although conceptually two collections seem to act 
      different, at source code level, they are instances of the very same 
      class (Java does not generate new classes for genericized types, unlike 
      C++).
    </p>
    <p>
      So while compiler helps in keeping typing straight, there is little 
      runtime help to either enforce this, or allow other code to deduce 
      expected type; there just isn't any difference from type perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. All Lost? Not at all</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But let's look at another example. Starting with a simple interface
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public interface Callable&lt;IN, OUT&gt; {<br>  public OUT call(IN argument);<br>}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      do you think following is true also?
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public void compare(Callable&lt;?,?&gt; callable1, Callable&lt;?,?&gt; callable2) {<br>  assertSame(callable1.getClass(), callable2.getClass());<br>}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Nope. Not necessarilly; classes may well be different. WTH?
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference here is that since Callable is an interface (and you can 
      not instantiate an interface), instances must be of some other type; and 
      there is a good chance they are different.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more importantly, if you use <a href="https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-classmate">Java 
      ClassMate</a> library (more on this in just a bit), we can even figure 
      out parameterization (unlike with earlier example, where all you could 
      see is that parameters are &quot;a subtype of java.lang.Object&quot;), so for 
      example we can do
    </p>
    <div>
      <hr>
      // Assume 'callable1' was of type:
    </div>
    <div>
      // class MyStringToIntList implements Callable&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; { 
      ... }
    </div>
    <pre>  TypeResolver resolver = new TypeResolver();
  ResolvedType type = resolver.resolve(callable1.getClass());
  List&lt;ResolvedType&gt; params = type.typeParametersFor(Callable.class);<br>  // so we know it has 2 parameters; from above, 'String' and 'List&lt;Integer&gt;'<br>  assertEquals(2, params.size());
  assertSame(String.class, params.get(0).getErasedType();<br>  // and second type is generic itself; in this case can directly access<br>  ResolvedType resultType = params.get(1);<br>  assertSame(List.class, resultType.getErasedType());<br>  List&lt;ResolvedType&gt; listParams = resultType.getTypeParameters();<br>  assertSame(Integer.class, listParams.get(0).getErasedType();<br>  //or, just to see types visually, try:<br>  String desc = type.getSignature(); // or 'getFullDescription'</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      How is THIS possible? (fun exercise: pick 5 of your favorite Java 
      experts; ask if above is possible, observe how most of them would have 
      said &quot;nope, not a chance&quot; :-) )
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Long live generics -- hidden deep, deep within</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically generic type information is actually stored in class 
      definitions, in 3 places:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When defining parent type information (&quot;super type&quot;); parameterization 
        for base class and base interface(s) if any
      </li>
      <li>
        For generic field declarations
      </li>
      <li>
        For generic method declarations (return, parameter and exception types)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is the first place where ClassMate finds its stuff. When resolving a 
      Class, it will traverse the inheritance hierarchy, recomposing type 
      parameterizations. This is a rather involved process, mostly due to type 
      aliasing, ability for interfaces to use different signatures and so on. 
      In fact, trying to do this manually first looks feasible, but if you try 
      it via all wildcarding, you will soon realize why having a library do it 
      for you is a nice thing...
    </p>
    <p>
      So the important thing to learn is this: <i><b>to retain run-time 
      generic type information, you MUST pass concrete sub-types which resolve 
      generic types via inheritance</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is where JDK collection types bring in the problem (wrt this 
      particular issue): concerete types like ArrayList still take generic 
      parameters; and this is why runtime instances do not have generic type 
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to put this is that when using a subtype, say:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  MyStringList list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;() { }<br>  // can use ClassMate now, a la:<br>  ResolvedType type = resolver.resolve(list.getClass());<br>  // type itself has no parameterization (concrete non-generic class); but it does implement List so:
  List&lt;ResolvedType&gt; params = type.typeParametersFor(List.class);<br>  assertSame(String.class, params.get(0).getErasedType());  </pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      which once again would retain usable amount of generic type information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Real world usage?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above might seem as an academic exercise; but it is not. When designing 
      typed APIs, many callbacks would actually benefit from proper generic 
      typing. And of special interest are callbacks or handlers that need to 
      do type conversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, my favorite Database access library, jDBI, makes use of 
      this functionality (using embedded ClassMate) to figure out data-binding 
      information without requiring extra Class argument. That is, you could 
      pass something like (not an actual code sample):
    </p>
    <pre>  MyPojo value = dbThingamabob.query(queryString, handler);</pre>
    <p>
      instead of what would more commonly requested:
    </p>
    <pre>  MyPojo value = dbThingamabob.query(queryString, handler, MyPojo.class);</pre>
    <p>
      and framework could still figure out what kind of thing 'handler' would 
      handle, assuming it was a generic interface caller has to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      difference may seem minute, but this can actually help a lot by 
      simplifying some aspects of type passing, and remove one particular mode 
      of error.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. More on ClassMate</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above actually barely scratch surface of what <a href="https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-classmate">ClassMate</a> 
      provides. Although it is already tricky to find &quot;simple&quot; 
      parameterization for main-level classes, there are much more trickier 
      things. Specifically, resolving types of Fields and Methods (return 
      types, parameters). Given classes like:
    </p>
    <pre>  public interface Base&lt;T&gt; {
    public T getStuff();
  }
  public class ListBase&lt;T&gt; implements Base&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; {<br>    protected T value;<br>    protected ListBase(T v) { value = v; }<br>    public T getstuff() { return value; }<br>  }
  public class Actual implements ListBase&lt;String&gt; {<br>    public Actual(List&lt;String&gt; value) { super(value; }<br>  }</pre>
    <p>
      you might be interested in figuring out, exactly what is the type of 
      return value of &quot;getStuff()&quot;. By eyeballing, you know it should be 
      &quot;List&lt;String&gt;&quot;, but bytecode does not tell this -- in fact, it just 
      tells it's &quot;T&quot;, basically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with ClassMate you can resolve it:
    </p>
    <pre>  // start with ResolvedType; need MemberResolver
  ResolvedType classType = resolver.resolve(Actual.class);<br>  MemberResolver mr = new MemberResolver(resolver);<br>  ResolvedTypeWithMembers beanDesc = mr.resolve(classType, null, null);<br>  ResolvedMethod[] members = bean.getMemberMethods();<br>  ResolvedType returnType = null;<br>  for (ResolvedMethod m : members) {<br>    if (&quot;getStuff&quot;.equals(m.getName())) {<br>      returnType = m.getReturnType();<br>    }<br>  }<br>  // so, we should get<br>  assertSame(List.class, returnType.getErasedType());<br>  ResolvedType elemType = returnType.getTypeParameters().get(0);<br>  assertSame(String.class, elemType.getErasedType();<br></pre>
    <p>
      and get the information you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Why so complicated for nested types? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that is obvious from code samples is that code that uses 
      ClassMate is not as simple as one might hope. Handling of nested generic 
      types, specifically, is bit verbose in some cases (specifically: when 
      type we are resolving does not directly implement type we are interested 
      in)<br>Why is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason is that there is a wide variety of interfaces that any class 
      can (and often does) implement. Further, parameterizations may vary at 
      different levels, due to co-variance (ability to override methods with 
      more refined return types). This means that it is not practical to &quot;just 
      resolve it all&quot; -- and even if this was done, it is not in general 
      obvious what the &quot;main type&quot; would be. For these reasons, you need to 
      manually request parameterization for specific generic classes and 
      interfaces as you traverse type hierarchy: there is no other way to do 
      it.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Notes on upgrading Jackson from 1.9 to 2.0</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      If you have existing code that uses Jackson version 1.x, and you would 
      like to see how to upgrade to 2.0, there isn't much documentation around 
      yet; although <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20">Jackson 
      2.0 release</a> page does outline all the major changes that were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's try to see what kind of steps are typically needed (note: this 
      is based on Jackson 2.0 upgrade experiences by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pamonrails">@pamonrails</a> 
      -- thanks Pierre!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>0. Pre-requisite: start with 1.9</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, I assume code to upgrade works with Jackson 1.9, and does 
      not use any deprecated interfaces (many methods and some classes were 
      deprecated during course of 1.x; all deprecated things went away with 
      2.0). So if your code is using an older 1.x version, the first step is 
      usually to upgrade to 1.9, as this simplifies later steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Update Maven / JAR dependencies</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is to upgrade jars. Depending on your build 
      system, you can either get jars from <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonDownload">Jackson 
      Download</a> page, or update Maven dependencies. New Maven dependencies 
      are:
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;<br>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-databind&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      The main thing to note is that instead of 2 jars (&quot;core&quot;, &quot;mapper&quot;), 
      there are now 3: former core has been split into separate &quot;annotations&quot; 
      package and remaining &quot;core&quot;; latter contains streaming/incremental 
      parser/generator components. And &quot;databind&quot; is a direct replacement of 
      &quot;mapper&quot; jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, you will need to update dependencies to supporting jars like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mr Bean: com.fasterxml.jackson.module / jackson-module-mrbean
      </li>
      <li>
        Smile binary JSON format: com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat / 
        jackson-dataformat-smile
      </li>
      <li>
        JAX-RS JSON provider: com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs / 
        jackson-jaxrs-json-provider
      </li>
      <li>
        JAXB annotation support (&quot;xc&quot;): com.fasterxml.jackson.module / 
        jackson-module-jaxb-annotations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      these, and many many more extension modules have their own project pages 
      under <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/">FasterXML Git repo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Import statements</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Jackson 2.0 code lives in Java packages, you will need to change 
      import statements. Although most changes are mechanical, there isn't 
      strict set of mappings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I have done this is to simply use an IDE like Eclipse, and 
      remove all invalid import statements; and then use Eclipse functionality 
      to find new packages. Typical import changes include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Core types: org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory/JsonParser/JsonGenerator 
        -&gt; com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory/JsonParser/JsonGenerator
      </li>
      <li>
        Databind types: org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper -&gt; 
        com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper
      </li>
      <li>
        Standard annotations: org.codehaus.jackson.annotate.JsonProperty -&gt; 
        com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is often convenient to just use wildcards imports for main categories 
      (com.fasterxml.jackson.core.*, com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*, 
      com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. SerializationConfig.Feature, DeserializationConfig.Feature</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next biggest change was that of refactoring on/off Features, 
      formerly defined as inner Enums of SerializationConfig and 
      DeserializationConfig classes. For 2.0, enums were moved to separate 
      stand-alone enums:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <i>DeserializationFeature</i> contains most of entries from former 
        DeserializationConfig.Feature
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>SerializationFeature</i> contains most of entries from former 
        SerializationConfig.Feature
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Entries that were NOT moved along are ones that were shared by both, and 
      instead were added into new <i>MapperFeature</i> enumeration, for 
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        SerializationConfig.Feature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION became 
        MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>4. Tree model method name changes (JsonNode)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although many methods (and some classes) were renamed here and there, 
      mostly these were one-offs. But one area where major naming changes were 
      done was with Tree Model -- this because 1.x names were found to be 
      rather unwieldy and unnecessarily verbose. So we decided that it would 
      make sense to try to do a &quot;big bang&quot; name change with 2.0, to get to a 
      clean(er) baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changes made were mostly of following types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>getXxxValue</i>() changes to <i>xxValue</i>(): getTextValue() -&gt; 
        textValue(), getFieldNames() -&gt; fieldNames() and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        getXxxAsYyy() changes to asYyy(): getValueAsText() -&gt; asText()<b>
</b>      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>5. Miscellaneous</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some classes were removed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        CustomSerializerFactory, CustomDeserializerFactory: should instead use 
        Module (like SimpleModule) for adding custom serializers, deserializers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>6. What else?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is definitely an incomplete list. Please let me know what I missed, 
      when you try upgrading!
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 2.0: CSV-compatible as well</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      (note: for general information on Jackson 2.0.0, see the previous 
      article, &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/03/entry_466.html">Jackson 
      2.0.0 released</a>&quot;; or, for XML support, see &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2012/03/entry_467.html">Not 
      just for JSON any more -- also in XML</a>&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I talked about XML, it is good to follow up with another 
      commonly used, if somewhat humble data format: Comma-Separated Values 
      (&quot;CSV&quot; for friends and foes).
    </p>
    <p>
      As you may have guessed... Jackson 2.0 supports CSV as well, via <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-csv">jackson-dataformat-csv</a> 
      project, hosted at GitHub
    </p>
    <p>
      For attention-span-challenged individuals, checkout <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-csv">Project 
      Page</a>: it contains tutorial that can get you started right away.<br>For 
      others, let's have a slight detour talking through design, so that 
      additional components involved make some sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. In the beginning there was a prototype</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing Jackson 1.8, I got to one of my wishlist projects: that 
      of being able to process CSV using Jackson. The reason for this is 
      simple: while simplistic and under-specified, CSV is very commonly used 
      for exchanging tabular datasets.<br>In fact, it (in variant forms, 
      &quot;pipe-delimited&quot;, &quot;tab-delimited&quot; etc) may well be the most widely used 
      data format for things like Map/Reduce (Hadoop) jobs, analytics 
      processing pipelines, and all kinds of scripting systems running on Unix.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Problem: not &quot;self-describing&quot;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One immediate challenge is that of lacking information on meaning of 
      data, beyond basic division between rows and columns for data. Compared 
      to JSON, for example, one neither necessarily knows which &quot;property&quot; a 
      value is for, nor actual expected type of the value. All you might know 
      is that row 6 has 12 values, expressed as Strings that look vaguely like 
      numbers or booleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again, sometimes you do have name mapping as the first row of 
      the document: if so, it represents column names. You still don't have 
      datatype declarations but at least it is a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally any library that supports CSV reading and writing should support 
      different commonly used variations; from optional header line (mentioned 
      above) to different separators (while name implies just comma, other 
      characters are commonly used, such as tabs and pipe symbol) and possibly 
      quoting/escaping mechanisms (some variants allow backslash escaping).<br>And 
      finally, it would be nice to expose both &quot;raw&quot; sequence and high-level 
      data-binding to/from POJOs, similar to how Jackson works with JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. So expose basic &quot;Schema&quot; abstraction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      To unify different ways of defining mapping between property names and 
      columns, Jackson now supports general concept of a Schema. While 
      interface itself is little more than a tag interface (to make it 
      possible to pass an opaque type-specific Schema instance through 
      factories), data-format specific subtypes can and do extend 
      functionality as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of CSV, Schema (use of which is optional -- more on &quot;raw&quot; access 
      later on) defines:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Names of columns, in order -- this is mandatory
      </li>
      <li>
        Scalar datatypes columns have: these are coarse types, and this 
        information is optional
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note that the reason that type information is strictly optional is that 
      when it is missing, all data is exposed as Strings; and Jackson 
      databinding has extensive set of standard coercions, meaning that things 
      like numbers are conveniently converted as necessary. Specifying type 
      information, then, can help in validating contents and possibly 
      improving performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Constructing &quot;CSV Schema&quot; objects</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      How does one get access to these Schema objects? Two ways: build 
      manually, or construct from a type (Class).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with latter, using same POJO type as with earlier XML 
      example:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  public enum Gender { MALE, FEMALE };
  // Note: MUST ensure a stable ordering; either alphabetic, or explicit
  // (JDK does not guarantee order of properties)
  @JsonPropertyOrder({ &quot;name&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;verified&quot;, &quot;image&quot; })
   public class User {
   public Gender gender;
   public String name;
   public boolean verified;
   public byte[] image;
  }<br>  // note: we could use std ObjectMapper; but CsvMapper has convenience methods
  CsvMapper mapper = new CsvMapper();
  CsvSchema schema = mapper.schemaFor(User.class);</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      or, if we wanted to do this manually, we would do (omitting types, for 
      now):
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  CsvSchema schema = CsvSchema.builder()<br>   .addColumn(&quot;name&quot;) 
   .addColumn(&quot;gender&quot;)<br>   .addColumn(&quot;verified&quot;)<br>   .addColumn(&quot;image&quot;)<br>   .build();</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      And there is, in fact, the third source: reading it from the header 
      line. I will leave that as an exercise for readers (check the project 
      home page).
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage is identical, regardless of the source. Schemas can be used for 
      both reading and writing; for writing they are only mandatory if output 
      of the header line is requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. And databinding we go!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's consider the case of reading CSV data from file called 
      &quot;Users.csv&quot;, entry by entry. Further, we assume there is no header row 
      to use or skip (if there is, the first entry would be bound from that -- 
      there is no way for parser auto-detect a header row, since its structure 
      is no different from rest of data).
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to do this would be:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  MappingIterator&lt;Entry&gt; it = mapper<br>    .reader(User.class)<br>    .with(schema)<br>    .readValues(new File(&quot;Users.csv&quot;());<br>  List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();<br>  while (it.hasNextValue()) {<br>    User user = it.nextValue();<br>    // do something?<br>    list.add(user);<br>  }<br>  // done! (FileReader gets closed when we hit the end etc)</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Assuming we wanted instead to write CSV, we would use something like 
      this. Note that here we DO want to add the explicit header line for fun:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  // let's force use of Unix linefeeds:<br>  ObjectWriter writer = mapper<br>    .writer(schema.withLineSeparator(&quot;\n&quot;));<br>  writer.writeValue(new File(&quot;ModifiedUsers.csv&quot;), users);</pre>
    <hr>
    one feature that we took advantage of here is that CSV generator basically 
    ignores any and all array markers; meaning that there is no difference 
    whether we try writing an array, List or just basic sequence of objects.

    <p>
      <b>6. Data-binding (POJOs) vs &quot;Raw&quot; access</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although full data binding is convenient, sometimes we might just want 
      to deal with a sequence of arrays with String values. You can think of 
      this as an alternative to &quot;JSON Tree Model&quot;; an untyped primitive but 
      very flexible data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All you really have to do is to omit definition of the schema (which 
      will then change observe token sequence); and make sure not to enable 
      handling of header line<br>For this, code to use (for reading) looks 
      something like:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  CsvMapper mapper = new CsvMapper();<br>  MappingIterator&lt;Object[]&gt; it = mapper<br>   .reader(Object[].class)<br>   .readValues(
   &quot;1,null\nfoobar\n7,true\n&quot;);<br>  Object[] data = it.nextValue();<br>  assertEquals(2, data.length);<br>  // since we have no schema, everything exposed as Strings, really<br>  assertEquals(&quot;1&quot;, data[0]);<br>  assertEquals(&quot;null&quot;, data[1]);</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Finally, note that use of raw entries is the only way to deal with data 
      that has arbitrary number of columns (unless you just want to add 
      maximum number of bogus columns -- it is ok to have less data than 
      columns).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Sequences vs Arrays</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One potential inconvenience with access is that by default CSV is 
      exposed as a sequence of &quot;JSON&quot; Objects. This works if you want to read 
      entries one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you can also configure parser to expose data as an Array of Objects, 
      to make it convenient to read all the data as a Java array or Collection 
      (as mentioned earlier, this is NOT required when writing data, as array 
      markers have no effect on generation).
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not go into details, beyond pointing out that the configuration 
      to enable addition &quot;virtual array wrapper&quot; is:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>mapper.ensable(CsvParser.Feature.WRAP_AS_ARRAY);</pre>
    <hr>
    and after this you can bind entries as if they came in as an array: both 
    &quot;raw&quot; ones (Object[][]) and typed (List&lt;User&gt; and so on).

    <p>
      <b>8. Limitations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to JSON, CSV is more limited data format. So does this limit 
      usage of Jackson CSV reader?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The main limitation is that column values need to essentially be 
      scalar values (strings, numbers, booleans). If you do need more 
      structured types, you will need to work around this, usually by adding 
      custom serializers and deserializers: these can then convert structured 
      types into scalar values and back. However, if you end up doing lots of 
      this kind of work, you may consider whether CSV is the right format for 
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9. Test Drive!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As with all the other JSON alternatives, CSV extension is really looking 
      forward to more users! Let us know how things work.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Sorting large data sets in Java using Java-merge-sort</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      When sorting data sets in Java, life is easy if amount of data to 
      process is not huge: JDK has the basic sorting covered well. But if your 
      data is big enough not to fit in memory you are on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This often means that developers use basic Unix 'sort' command line 
      tool. But while it is a good package for basic textual sort -- and when 
      combined with other Unix pipeline tools, on whole range of column-based 
      alternatives -- it is limited in two sometimes crucial aspects:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Defining custom sorting (collation) order is difficult
      </li>
      <li>
        Interacting with external tools (including 'sort') from within JVM is 
        inherently difficult
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      But there is one less well-known alternative available: a relatively new 
      Java Open Source library available from Github: <a href="https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-merge-sort">java-merge-sort</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is java-merge-sort</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Java-merge-sort library implements basic external <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge 
      sort</a>, sorting algorithm typically used for disk-backed sorting. 
      Input and output are not limited to files; any <i>java.io.InputStream</i> 
      / <i>java.io.OutputStream</i> implementation will work just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorting library is designed to work as an ad-hoc tool (in fact, Jar 
      itself can be used as 'sort' tool) as well as a component of bigger data 
      processing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notable features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fully customizable input and output handlers, used for reading 
        external data into objects to be sorted and writing them back out 
        (handlers defined by providing factories that create instances)
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional custom comparators (if items read do not implement Comparable)
      </li>
      <li>
        Configurable merge factor (number of inputs merged in each pass); max 
        memory usage (which limits length of pre-sort segments -- more memory 
        used, fewer rounds needed)
      </li>
      <li>
        Configurable temporary file handling (defaults to using JDK default 
        temp files, deletions)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ability to cancel sorting jobs asynchronously
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>2. Using as command-line tool</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple way to use the library is as a stand-alone command tool; while 
      there are no specific benefits over standard 'sort' command (assuming 
      one is available), it can be used to test functionality. Usage is as 
      simple as:
    </p>
    <pre>  java -jar java-merge-sort-[VERSION].jar [input-file]</pre>
    <p>
      where 'input-file' is optional (if it is missing, will read from 
      standard input); and sorted output will be displayed to standard output.<br>Commonly 
      one will then redirect output to a file:
    </p>
    <pre>  java -jar java-merge-sort-[VERSION].jar unsorted.txt &gt; sorted.txt</pre>
    <p>
      Under the hood, this will run code from class <i>com.fasterxml.sort.std.TextFileSorter</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      which is both a concrete sorter implementation, and defines main() 
      method to act as a command-line tool.<br>Sort will be done line-by-line, 
      using basic lexicographic (~= alphabetic) sort which works for common 
      encodings like ASCII, Latin-1 and UTF-8.<br>Command will limit memory 
      usage to 50% of maximum heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Simple programmatic usage: textual file sort </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      More commonly java-merge-sort is used as a component of bigger 
      processing system. So let's have a look at basic usage as 'sort' 
      replacement, i.e. sorting text files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code to sort an input file into output file is:
    </p>
    <pre>  public void sort(InputFile in, OutputFile out) throws IOException<br>  {<br>    TextFileSorter sorter = new TextFileSorter(new SortConfig().withMaxMemoryUsage(20 * 1000 * 1000)); // use up to 20 megs<br>    sorter.sort(new FileInputStream(in), new FileOutputStream(out));<br>    // note: sort() will close InputStream, OutputStream after sorting<br>  }<br></pre>
    <p>
      which uses default configuration except for maximum memory usage 
      (default is 40 megs: which often works just fine)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Advanced usage: sort JSON files</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above example showed one benefit -- easy integration from Java code -- 
      but the real power comes from the fact that we can change input and 
      output handlers to deal with all kinds of data, to support advanced 
      sorting behavior. To demonstrate this, let's consider case where input 
      is a file that contains JSON entries: each line contains a JSON Object 
      like:
    </p>
    <p>
      { &quot;firstName&quot; : &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot; : &quot;Plumber&quot;, &quot;age&quot;:58 }
    </p>
    <p>
      and which we want to sort primary by age, from lowest to highest, and 
      than by name, alphabetic, first by last name, then by first name.<br>We 
      can bind this to a Java class like:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  public class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt;
  {
    public int age;
    public String firstName, lastName;

    public int compareTo(Person other) {
     int diff = age - other.age;
     if (diff == 0) {
      diff = lastName.compareTo(other.lastName);
      if (diff == 0) {
       diff = firstName.compareTo(other.firstName);
      }
     }
     return diff;
    }
  }</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      using Jackson JSON processor, and then sort entries using 
      java-merge-sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code to do this is bit more complicated; let's start with Sorter 
      implementation:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>import java.io.*;

import org.codehaus.jackson.JsonGenerator;
import org.codehaus.jackson.map.*;
import org.codehaus.jackson.type.JavaType;

import com.fasterxml.sort.std.StdComparator;

public class JsonPersonSorter extends Sorter&lt;Person&gt;
{
  public JsonFileSorter() throws IOException {
    this(entryType, new SortConfig(), new ObjectMapper());
  }

  public JsonFileSorter(SortConfig config, ObjectMapper mapper) throws IOException {
    this(mapper.constructType(Person.class), config, mapper);
  }

  public JsonFileSorter(JavaType entryType, SortConfig config, ObjectMapper mapper) throws IOException {
    super(config, new ReaderFactory(mapper.reader(entryType)),
      new WriterFactory(mapper),
      new StdComparator&lt;Person&gt;());
  }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    and supporting reading-related classes are:<hr>

    <pre>public class ReaderFactory extends DataReaderFactory&lt;Person&gt;
{
  private final ObjectReader _reader;
  public ReaderFactory(ObjectReader r) {
    _reader = r;
  }

  @Override
  public DataReader&lt;Person&gt; constructReader(InputStream in) throws IOException {
    MappingIterator&lt;Person&gt; it = _reader.readValues(in);
    return new Reader&lt;Person&gt;(it);
  }
}

public class Reader&lt;E&gt; extends DataReader&lt;E&gt;
{
  protected final MappingIterator&lt;E&gt; _iterator;
 
  public Reader(MappingIterator&lt;E&gt; it) {_i terator = it; }

  @Override
  public E readNext() throws IOException {
    if (_iterator.hasNext()) {
      return _iterator.nextValue();
    }
    return null;
  }
<br>  // not a good estimation, has to do for now (should count String lengths, estimate)
  @Override public int estimateSizeInBytes(E item) { return 100; }
  @Overridepu blic void close() throws IOException { } // auto-closes when we reach end
}</pre>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <hr>
    and writing-related classes:<hr>

    <pre>static class WriterFactory&lt;W&gt; extends DataWriterFactory&lt;W&gt;
{
  protected final ObjectMapper _mapper;

  public WriterFactory(ObjectMapper m) {
    _mapper = m;
  }

  @Override
  public DataWriter&lt;W&gt; constructWriter(OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    return new Writer&lt;W&gt;(_mapper, out);
  }
}

static class Writer&lt;E&gt; extends DataWriter&lt;E&gt;
{
  protected final ObjectMapper _mapper;
  protected final JsonGenerator _generator;

  public Writer(ObjectMapper mapper, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    _mapper = mapper;
    _generator = _mapper.getJsonFactory().createJsonGenerator(out);
  }

  @Override
  public void writeEntry(E item) throws IOException {
    _mapper.writeValue(_generator, item);
    // not 100% necesary, but for readability, add linefeeds
    _generator.writeRaw('\n');
  }

  @Override
  public void close() throws IOException {
    _generator.close();
  }
}<br><br>So with all of above, we could sort a file using:

   JsonFileSorter sorter = new JsonFileSorter();
   sorter.sort(inputFile, outputFile);</pre>
    <p>
      Which is pretty much identical to earlier code to sort a File; just with 
      different reader+writer configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Even more advanced: compress intermediate files?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many ways to customize processing; and one interesting idea is 
      to actually compress intermediate files (results of pre-sort, inputs to 
      later merge rounds); preferably using ultra-fast Java compressor like <a href="https://github.com/ning/compress">Ning 
      LZF</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code to do this would not be long -- it's just matter of changing 
      DataReaderFactory and DataWriterFactory to read/write files -- but I 
      will leave this up as an exercise to reader. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. More speed: configurations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main configuration switches that can be used to improve 
      speed:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Amount of memory used for pre-sorting: more memory to use, fewer 
        sorted segments are needed -- in fact, it may be possible to do the 
        whole sort in memory. Default memory to use is 40 megabytes (to 
        accomodate for default JDK max heap size of 64 megs)
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of inputs merged per round: default is 16 inputs, which should 
        be enough; but you can increase this to reduce number of merge rounds 
        needed (or reduce if you want to minimize number of open files, in 
        case you encounter problems)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>7. Future ideas</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at JSON sorting code, I realize that it would be easy to create 
      a generic sorter that uses Jackson. And not only would this support 
      sorting JSON files, but also files that use any other format Jackson 
      supports, such as Smile (out of the box, with 'SmileFactory'), <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-xml-databind">XML</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-csv">CSV</a> 
      and <a href="https://github.com/michel-kraemer/bson4jackson">BSON</a>!

     <h3 class="entry-header">Advanced filtering with Jackson, Json Filters</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      I wrote a bit earlier on &quot;<a href="/blog/archives/2011/02/entry_443.html">filtering 
      properties with Jackson</a>&quot;. While it was comprehensive in that all 
      main methods of filtering were covered, there wasn't much depth. 
      Specifically, only very basic usage of Json Filters (<i>@JsonFilter</i> 
      annotation, <i>SimpleFilterProvider</i> as provider) was considered. 
      This approach does allow more dynamic filtering than, say, <i>@JsonView</i>, 
      but it is still somewhat limited. So let's consider more advanced 
      customizability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Refresher on Json Filters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, so the basic idea with Json Filters is that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Classes can have an associated Filter Id, which defines logical filter 
        to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        A provider is needed to get the actual filter instance to use, given 
        id: this will be configured by assigning a FilterProvider (such as 
        'SimpleFilterProvider') to ObjectMapper or ObjectWriter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson will dynamically (and efficiently) resolve filter given class 
        uses, dynamically, allowing per-call reconfiguration of filtering.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      From this it is clear that there are 2 main things you can configure: 
      mechanism that is used to find Filter id of a given class, and mechanism 
      used for mapping this id to actual filter used (implementation of which 
      can be as complicated as you want).
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's have a look at both parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Configuring mapping from id to filter instance</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of mechanisms, latter one may be easier to understand and use: one just 
      has to implement '<i>FilterProvider</i>', which has but one method to 
      implement:
    </p>
    <pre>  public abstract class FilterProvider {
    public abstract BeanPropertyFilter findFilter(Object filterId);
  }</pre>
    <p>
      given this, 'SimpleFilterProvider' is little more than a <i>Map&lt;String,BeanPropertyFilter&gt;</i>, 
      except for adding couple of convenience factory methods that build 
      'SimpleBeanPropertyFilter' instances given property names, so you 
      typically just instantiate one with calls like:
    </p>
    <pre>  SimpleBeanPropertyFilter filter = SimpleBeanPropertyFilter.filterOutAllExcept(&quot;a&quot;));</pre>
    <p>
      which would out all properties except for one named &quot;a&quot;. This filter is 
      then configured with ObjectMapper like so:
    </p>
    <pre>  FilterProvider fp = new SimpleFilterProvider().addFilter(&quot;onlyAFilter&quot;, filter);
  objectMapper.writer(fp).writeValueAsString(pojo);</pre>
    <p>
      which would, then, apply to any Java type configured to use filter with 
      id &quot;onlyAFilter&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Configuring discovery of filter id</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      From above example we know we need to indicate classes that are to use 
      our &quot;onlyAFilter&quot;. The default mechanism is to use:
    </p>
    <pre>  @JsonFilter(&quot;onlyAFilter&quot;)
  public class FilteredPOJO {
    //...
  }</pre>
    <p>
      But this is just the default. How so? The way Jackson figures out its 
      annotation-based configuration is actually indirect, and fully 
      customizable: all interaction is through configured '<i>AnnotationIntrospector'</i> 
      object, which amongst other things defines this method:
    </p>
    <pre>  public Object findFilterId(AnnotatedClass ac);</pre>
    <p>
      which is called when serializer needs to determine id of the filter to 
      apply (if any) for given class. Since the default implementation 
      (org.codehaus.jackson.map.introspect.JacksonAnnotationIntrospector) has 
      everything else working fine, what we can do is to sub-class it and 
      override this method.<br>For example:
    </p>
    <pre>  public class MyFilteringIntrospector extends JacksonAnnotationIntrospector
  {
    @Override
    public Object findFilterId(AnnotatedClass ac) {
      // First, let's consider @JsonFilter by calling superclass
      Object id = super.findFilterId(ac);
      // but if not found, use our own heuristic; say, just use class name as filter id, if there's &quot;Filter&quot; in name:
      if (id == null) {
        String name = ac.getName();
        if (name.indexOf(&quot;Filter&quot;) &gt;= 0) {
          id = name;
        }
      }
      return id;
    }
  }</pre>
    <p>
      Above functionality is just to show what is possible, not that it makes 
      sense. Alternatively you could of course define your own annotations to 
      check; or have List of known class names, check class definition or 
      interfaces type implements. The main point is just that you are not 
      limited to using <i>@JsonFilter</i> annotation, but can use pretty much 
      any logic you want, within limits of your coding skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only caveat is that the resolution from Class to matching id is only 
      guaranteed to be called once per ObjectMapper; so any variation in 
      filtering of specific class needs to happen at either mapping of id to 
      filter, or within filter itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Don't be afraid of sub-classing (Jackson)AnnotationIntrospector</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, the key take away might as well be the fact that 
      AnnotationIntrospector is designed to be customizable. It was initially 
      created to allow easy reuse of JAXB annotations (via <i>JAXBAnnotationIntrospector</i>; 
      combining things with <i>AnnotationIntrospector.Pair</i>); but it is 
      also a very powerful general-purpose customization mechanism. But at 
      this point quite underused one at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Addendum</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some additional notes based on feedback I received:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Custom <i>BeanPropertyFilter</i> implementations are obviously 
        powerful too: not only can they completely change what (if anything) 
        gets written for property, they can base this on all configuration 
        accessible via <i>SerializerProvider</i> which is passed to 
        serializeAsField(): for example, it can check to see what 
        serialization view is available by calling '<i>provider.getSerializationView()</i>'.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Introducing "jvm-compressor-benchmark" project</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      I recently started one new open source project; this time being inspired 
      by success of another OS project I had been involved in, project is &quot;<a href="https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki">jvm-serializers</a>&quot; 
      benchmark originally started by Eishay and built by a community of java 
      databinder/serializer experts. What has been great with this project has 
      been amount of energy it seemed ot feed back to development of 
      serializers: highly visible competition for best performance seems to 
      have improved efficiency of libraries a lot. I only wish we had 
      historical benchmark data to compare to see exactly how far have the 
      fastest Java serializers come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I figured that there are other groups of libraries where high 
      performance matters, but where there is lack of actual solid 
      benchmarking information. So while there are a few compression 
      performance benchmarks, they are often non-applicable for Java 
      developers: partly because they just compare native compressor codecs, 
      and partly because focus is more often only on space-efficiency (how 
      much compression is achieved) with little consideration of performance 
      of compression. The last part is particularly frustrating as in many use 
      cases there is significant trade-off between space and time efficiency 
      (compression rate vs time used for compression).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, this is where the new project -- &quot;<a href="https://github.com/ning/jvm-compressor-benchmark">jvm-compressor-benchmark</a>&quot; 
      -- comes from. I hope it will allow fair comparison of compression 
      codecs available on JVM, to be used by Java and other JVM lagnuages; and 
      also bring in some friendly competition between developers of 
      compression codecs.
    </p>
    <p>
      First version compares half a dozen of compression formats and codecs, 
      from the venerable deflate/gzip (which offers pretty good compression 
      ratio with decent speed) to higher-compression-but-slower-operation 
      alternatives (bzip2) and lower-compression-but-very-fast alternatives 
      like <a href="https://github.com/ning/compress">lzf</a>, <a href="http://www.quicklz.com/">quicklz</a> 
      and the new kid on the block, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy-java/">Snappy</a> 
      (via JNI).
    </p>
    <p>
      And although the best way to evaluate results is to run tests on your 
      machine, using data sets you care about (which I strongly encourage!), <a href="https://github.com/ning/jvm-compressor-benchmark/wiki">Project 
      wiki</a> does have some pretty diagrams for tests run on &quot;standard&quot; data 
      sets gathered from the web. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: please check the project out -- at the very least it should give 
      you an idea of how many options there are above and beyond basic 
      JDK-provided gzip. 
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. Contributions are obviously also welcome -- anyone willing to tackle 
      Java version of 7-zip's LZMA, for example, would be most welcome!
    </p></p>
