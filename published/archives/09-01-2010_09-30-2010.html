			<h3 class="entry-header">Every day Jackson usage, part 2: Open Content</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      <b>1. Open content vs Closed content</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In content modeling, closed content models are ones where everything 
      that cam be included in piece of content is fully defined, usually using 
      static schema of some sort. Open content differs in that it only defines 
      subset of possible content, one that is recognized, but where additional 
      content may exist; and it is possible to also have multiple 
      complementary content models to describe a single document. There are 
      degrees in between; for example, it may be possible to &quot;open up&quot; content 
      models by allowing some amount of content to be added on specified 
      extension points. Open models are also useful in cases where currently 
      used model is static (and could be described with a closed model), but 
      where it is reasonable to expect that model may need to evolve, to be 
      extended with additional content items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Object models of programming languages vary from closed to open models. 
      Java's object models is very much a closed one, for example, defined by 
      static class definitions; while one can extend classes, instances can 
      not be dynamically extended. On the other end of spectrum, content 
      models of scripting languages like Javascript are open: in Javascript, 
      you can add new properties and even functions on the fly. Content typing 
      for more dynamic languages is sometimes called &quot;duck typing&quot; (&quot;if it 
      walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, is most likely a duck...&quot;) as 
      opposed to traditional &quot;static typing&quot; (or even &quot;dynamic typing&quot;, which 
      just changes applicability but does not lift existence of strong typing).
    </p>
    <p>
      When modelling data content expressed using data formats like JSON, both 
      options are possible. Some tools only support one kind: for example, DOM 
      API for XML supports open content model; and data binding libraries like 
      JAXB typically support only (or mostly) closed content models derived 
      from Java class or XML Schema definitions. Combinations are also 
      possible: although XML and DOM allow any kind of content, one can use 
      XML Schema as kind of straight-jacket to force a closed (or mostly 
      closed) content model on otherwise loose data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Jackson: open or closed? Both!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson has traditionally support both general content model types: 
      low-level streaming interface is content agnostic (and could be viewed 
      as very much open model); Tree Model is for handling open content; and 
      Data Binding supports handling of closed content, with limited 
      functionality to support some aspects of open content models. Before 
      having a closed looked what Jackson has to offer, let's first consider 
      need why used Open Content may be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Need for Open Content </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A rule of thumb regarding code and data is that data typically has much 
      longer life-cycle than code. A crude analogy could be that whereas there 
      are books that are hundreds years old, there are few printing presses of 
      some age in existence. Same will be true for all kinds of documents, 
      from papyrus to microfiche and web pages. As such, life cycle of content 
      models -- logical constructs that define structure and content of 
      documents -- will be potentially very long. And due to needs for 
      backwards compatibility, content models must evolve, to accomodate for 
      new kinds of content that co-exists with old content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This need for evolving data models is an obvious reason why closed 
      content models are problematic: to use a closed content model, one has 
      to believe that the official (first) definition is basically complete 
      (so no changes are needed); or alternatively that one has power over all 
      systems that handle said content (to allow for changing those systems 
      when model changes). Needless to say, few have (or should have) faith in 
      having either of these powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open content, then, is based on assumption that over time new content 
      will be added. This does not mean haphazard changes, but rather changes 
      that extend model by creating supersets: old model is a subset of 
      extended version. There are actually other interesting reasons for using 
      open content models -- for example, when multiple &quot;facets&quot; of an item 
      are expressed in a single document, it may be useful to have multiple 
      complementary partial content models; and considering them open models 
      allows peaceful co-existence -- but for this article, it is enough to 
      focus on particular issue of data evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      So where is the catch? A significant problem with open content models is 
      that of handling open content documents by applications: given that 
      model is likely to evolve over time (or that content is only partially 
      described by model, due to other parts of data being irrelevant for 
      specific application), applications need to be mindful not to assume 
      immutability or completeness of model itself. And this is where we can 
      go back to Jackson. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Jackson Data Binding: simplest tools, ignoring unknown properties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson 1.5 and prior allowed rudimentary ways to allow &quot;unspecified 
      content&quot;. For the most part it consisted of ability to specify that 
      unrecognized (&quot;unknown&quot;) properties can either be ignored, or handled 
      using custom handlers. See &quot;<a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHowToIgnoreUnknown">Ignoring 
      Unknown Properties</a>&quot; for more details of how this can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while it is useful to be able to prevent processing errors when 
      content models are extended, it has one unfortunate effect: any such 
      unrecognized content is promptly dropped, and will not be serialized if 
      content is to be written out as JSON again. This is harmful both for 
      cases where new content structures are added, and where &quot;irrelevant&quot; 
      parts of documents are very much relevant for other systems that process 
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Jackson Data Binding: handling of &quot;any content&quot;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson 1.6 addresses issue by adding one new method for handling 
      content extensions, which allows for better dealing with Open Content: 
      ability to define both &quot;any setter&quot; and &quot;any getter&quot;. Consider example 
      POJO (from &quot;@<a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonFeatureAnyGetter">JsonAnyGetter</a>&quot; 
      wiki page):
    </p>
    <pre>  public class ExtensibleBean
  {
public String name; // we always have name

private void HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; properties;

public ExtensibleBean() { }

@JsonAnySetter public void add(String key, String value) { // name does not matter
  properties.put(key, value);
}

@JsonAnyGetter public Map&lt;String,String&gt; properties() { // note: for 1.6.0 MUST use non-getter name; otherwise doesn't matter
  return properties;
}
  }    </pre>
    <p>
      The idea is that basically you can have fully-defined properties (here 
      just &quot;name&quot;), handled using (partial) Closed Model. But you can also 
      specify that there is per-type general handler for anything that is not 
      recognized. A typical handler would just use Java Map to store such 
      values, using native simple binding (of Maps, Lists, wrappers). And not 
      only store them (deserialized using @JsonAnySetter, which already 
      existed since version 1.1), but also serialize them back as JSON using <b>@JsonAnyGetter</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: but given that any explicit handling of these extensions requires 
      new code -- after all, how could you write code for handling things you 
      don't even recognize? -- how does this help?
    </p>
    <p>
      It helps because this way extended data can be passed through to systems 
      that may know how to handle it. So we will avoid both
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        failing on unrecognized content, or worse
      </li>
      <li>
        dropping unrecognized content silently
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      both of which would have nasty consequences for later versions; and 
      latter being especially nasty as it can essentially corrupt data. And as 
      data is typically much more valuable than code, one should rather take a 
      processing error (which indicates a problem to fix) rather than data 
      corruption which will only bite later, and cause much more pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Jackson Data Binding: handling of content as &quot;untyped&quot;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is actually another way to deal with unknown content, in cases 
      where extension points are defined in advance: since it is possible to 
      use loose types like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        java.lang.Object: all JSON constructs can be mapped to specific 
        matching &quot;native&quot; Java type: JSON booleans become java.lang.Boolean, 
        JSON Strings Java Strings, JSON Arrays as Java Lists and JSON Objects 
        as Map
      </li>
      <li>
        org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode: all JSON constructs can also be 
        expressed as JSON trees, as per Jackson's Tree Model. This can also be 
        considered &quot;untyped&quot; binding
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      it is then possible to just declare that a JSON property just maps to a 
      Java object without knowing anything about structure of the type. The 
      main downside is that you still need to know specific properties that 
      are of such unknown (or loose) type. Using loose typing has others uses 
      as well; it is commonly used for multi-step type conversions, where type 
      may only be known at a later point (possibly as a result of data made 
      available by initial data binding; or by a later processing stage that 
      takes initially bound data as its input).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Other related work</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, approach taken with many processing libraries is to 
      allow filtering out content that is not recognized. One example is <a href="http://staxmate.codehaus.org/">StaxMate</a> 
      (XML processing library), which implements cursors that only show 
      content that is specified: you get what you want to get (or &quot;see what 
      you want to see&quot;); and anything else can be ignored.<br>This works 
      reasonably well for read-only use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other data binding frameworks also support similar notions of foreign 
      content: JAXB, for example, has @XmlAny annotation to denote content of 
      unknown type; as well as ability to bind sub-trees into generic 
      &quot;untyped&quot; content (express as type-agnostic DOM elements).
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      <b>UPDATE, 05-October-2010</b>: I just learnt that 1.6.0 release 
      contained a small but annoying bug which meant that if @JsonAnyGetter 
      method had valid getter signature (getXxx() with no arguments), 
      properties would be duplicated. This is fixed for 1.6.1, but if using 
      1.6.0, make sure name is not 'getXxx()' to avoid problems.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 1.6, improved Tree Model access; finding values of all instances of specified property</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One class of improvements included in <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease16">Jackson 
      1.6</a> are improvements to Tree Model accessors, added to JsonNode.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for example, if you have an array of User objects:
    </p>
    <pre>[
  { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Billy&quot;, &quot;id&quot; : 123 },
  { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;id&quot; : 456, &quot;extraInfo&quot; : { &quot;flags&quot; : 3 } } // and so on   
]</pre>
    <p>
      and you would just like to get list of names of all users, formerly you 
      needed to write piece of glue code to get names, build a List and so on. 
      While simple to do, it is boring and ultimately error-prone thing to 
      have to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So new functionality that was added can simplify such tasks:
    </p>
    <pre>  JsonNode root = objectMapper.readTree(json);
  List&lt;JsonNode&gt; nameNodes = root.findValues(&quot;name&quot;);
  // or, given we know they are Strings, we can get actual name values directly:
  List&lt;string&gt; nameStrings = root.findValuesAsText(&quot;name&quot;);</pre>
    <p>
      Or, if you actually wanted to just find Users that have property 
      &quot;extraInfo&quot; defined, you would do:
    </p>
    <pre>  List&lt;JsonNode&gt; nodes = root.findParents(&quot;extraInfo&quot;);</pre>
    <p>
      Granted, these find methods are not superbly powerful -- hopefully we 
      can work on actual JSON path expressions in future -- but they help a 
      bit for common cases.<br>And even without formal expression language, 
      perhaps we could add filter-based alternatives for more concise 
      recursive-descent lookups (findValues(new NodeFilter() { .... } ) ?)
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">XML Schema: case of a "simple" element with text and one attribute</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      It has been a while since I worked with XML Schemas. But after immersing 
      myself in delicious XML Schema material (to revamp Woodstox XML Schema 
      support), I realized that it has not been nearly enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That XML Schema is a very complex way of doing not so much more than 
      what DTDs allow (basically, main tangible useful thing you get is plaing 
      nice with namespaces -- necessary, but not much to write home about) is 
      not news, but rather a recognized fact. But just how complicated AND 
      verbose it is isn't obvious when you do not have write schemas. So here 
      is the very first thing I had to do again: write a schema for single 
      element with text as content, and a single text attribute. How much xml 
      would that be? One or two lines?
    </p>
    <p>
      No such luck. Unless I am mistaken, here's how to do it (adapted from 
      Eric van der List's XML Schema book, highly recommended):
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'&gt;
 &lt;xs:element name='price'&gt;
  &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
   &lt;xs:simpleContent&gt;
     &lt;xs:extension base='xs:int'&gt;
       &lt;xs:attribute name='currency' type='xs:string' /&gt;
     &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
   &lt;/xs:simpleContent&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
 &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;&quot;  </pre>
    <p>
      God have mercy on us... this makes Java look like Forth in comparison. 
      What were they thinking?

			<h3 class="entry-header">Lazy Coder Cuisine: Making Ciabatta -- lots of work, tasty rewards</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Here is something different within culinary domain. I love good bread, 
      and at times it has been challenging to find good stuff in this 
      continent. But while I have not located all kinds of good breads that 
      exist in northern parts of the old continent, I have found new good 
      things over here. One of those things is ciabatta, which is actually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta">fairly 
      recent invention</a>, despite coming from established culinary 
      superpower of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: while it is possible to find good ciabatta here in Seattle area, 
      it can be bit pricey. And beside economy, freshness is still a 
      challenge. So I figured that perhaps it might not be beyond my 
      capabilities (or rather, team Saloranta's capabilities -- my wife is a 
      superior chef these days) to bake a decent load of ciabatta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: we settled for about the first Google hit, and specifically on <a href="http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/ciabatta/Detail.aspx">this 
      recipe</a>. Reading through it, it became clear that this is not one of 
      Lazy Coder's recipes; process is surprisingly lengthy for bread making 
      (granted, variance for kinds of breads is huge), if nothing 
      extra-ordinary. Specifically it's actually possible to get it all done 
      within a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long story short: following recipe closely, and using a 20$ pizza stone 
      from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (pre-heating for bit over suggested 45 minutes) 
      produced 2 rather tasty instances. Even 2 steps that felt tricky 
      (kneading by hand -- I suspect that time mentioned is way overestimate, 
      2 minutes is probably fine -- maybe machines have less torque or 
      something; and getting the thing on pizza stone from parchment paper, 
      should have added flour on parchment) failed to ruin the results. So two 
      thumbs up for the recipe and the idea, as long as you have time and 
      energy to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I would suggest for anyone who tries this is to just double 
      the dose and make 4 Ciabattas: effort is not doubled, and so if you go 
      through the trouble, might as well get enough to eat for a while, or to 
      offer for good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly: one nice thing about Ciabatta is that it is delicious with 
      very little else: for example, with melted butter. Yum.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. On somewhat related note; another late pleasant finding was that US 
      &quot;genoa salami&quot; is close enough to old world &quot;metwurst&quot; (almost as close 
      as &quot;gypsy salami&quot; which is the best US match so far). Couple this with 
      good cheese (sharp cheddar, emmentaler [aka &quot;swiss cheese&quot;], gouda), and 
      you get pretty close to perfect &quot;default topping&quot; for all kinds of 
      breads -- not just dark sourdough ryebread (finnish specialty), but all 
      kinds of white wheat-based breads too.
    </p></p>

			<p><p>
      After almost 6 months of development, <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease16">Jackson 
      1.6</a> was finally released last night (<a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonDownload">download</a> 
      responsibly!). Despite preliminary plans of creating a somewhat smaller 
      incremental version after the big bang of 1.5, over time things changed 
      and we actually have another biggie-size increment at our hands. But 
      whereas 1.5 was focused on implementing a complete solution for just one 
      big hairy problem (handling of polymorphic types), 1.6 is a full frontal 
      assault against remaining hard-to-handle use cases. It both expands set 
      of use cases that Jackson can handle and improves support for existing 
      use cases making usage even more convenient and performant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the full list of features, check out FasterXML <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease16">Jackson 
      1.6 features</a> page and <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/1.6.0/release-notes/VERSION">1.6.0 
      release notes</a>. But here is an overview of most notable changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Structural changes: 2 new optional jars</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At surface level, one obvious thing is that there are now 2 more 
      optional jars you can include. They contain new functionality known as 
      &quot;Mr Bean&quot; and &quot;Project Smile&quot;; more on these in a moment. There is also 
      an addition of &quot;jackson-all&quot; jar which simply contains everything from 
      all the other jars; to be used when you just don't want n+1 separate 
      jars around and would rather have a single fat jar for all Jackson stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise packaging remains the same; and backwards compatibility works 
      as expected for a &quot;minor&quot; release -- that is, code written for earlier 
      1.x versions should work as is. Considering scope of changes, upgrade 
      from versions 1.4 and 1.5 specifically should be very safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Shiny New Things: Big 4 of 1.6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to group changes and improvements. Let's start 
      with what I view as 4 major new features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ObjectMapper.updateValue(): ability to merge changes, deltas
      </li>
      <li>
        Automatic Parent/Child reference handling: better support for 
        Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) values (Hibernate, iBatis)
      </li>
      <li>
        Interface/Abstract class Materialization (&quot;Mr Bean&quot;): give Jackson 
        your interfaces, forget about boiler plate classes
      </li>
      <li>
        JSON-compatible high-performance binary data format (&quot;Project Smile&quot;): 
        even more performance without sacrificing convenience of schema-free 
        data model
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>2.1 ObjectMapper.updateValue() </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I actually wrote '<a href="http://jackson-users.ning.com/profiles/blogs/new-feature-ability-to-update">New 
      feature: ability to &quot;update&quot; beans, not just recreate</a>' a 
      while ago, since this was the first new thing implemented after 1.5. The 
      idea is that you can now optionally provide an existing object (&quot;root 
      value&quot;) when deserializing, and ObjectMapper can just update its 
      properties, instead of instantiating a new object. This is useful when 
      merging properties, for example by using default values and overrides, 
      possibly with multiple levels of priorities, or when loading settings 
      from multiple sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage is as simple as:
    </p>
    <pre>  Properties properties = new Properties();
  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  mapper.updatingReader(properties).readValue(jsonWithOverrides);
  // can call multiple times if you want to merge multiple sets of values:
  mapper.updatingReader(properties).readValue(higherPriorityOverrides);</pre>
    <p>
      method ObjectMapper.updatingReader() creates a Reader of type 
      ObjectReader, which can be further configured (this also reduces number 
      of methods that need to be added to ObjectMapper itself). Object to 
      update can be any type supported by Jackson's regular 
      ObjectMapper.readValue().
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.2 Parent/Child reference handling </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that has been problematic for serialization is linkage between 
      parent and child objects for trees and ORM-mapped classes (or for simple 
      double-linked lists). Problem is that without special handling this 
      cyclic dependency causes serialization failure. Prior to 1.6 the way to 
      handle this problem has been to suppress serialization of one of links 
      (usually the &quot;back link&quot; from child object to parent), and lose back 
      link; or to write custom serializers and deserializers. Jackson 1.6 
      offers a better way: use of 2 new annotations, <b>@JsonManagedReference</b> 
      and <b>@JsonBackReference</b>. Consider an example of a two classes:
    </p>
    <pre>public class Root {
  @JsonManagedReference
  public Leaf[] leaves; // works for simple POJOs, arrays, Lists, Maps etc
}

public class Leaf {
  @JsonManagedReference
  public Root root;

  public String id;
}</pre>
    <p>
      serialization of a Root object with 2 Leaf objects would produce 
      something like:
    </p>
    <pre>{
  &quot;leaves&quot; : [
    { &quot;id&quot; : &quot;leaf1Id&quot; },
    { &quot;id&quot; : &quot;leaf2Id&quot; }
  ]
}</pre>
    <p>
      which is similar to just using @JsonIgnore on 'public Root id;' field. 
      But the real trick is with deserialization, which will automatically set 
      'root' field to point to deserialized instance, as if that link was 
      serialized.
    </p>
    <p>
      So behavior is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        @JsonManagedReference will be used as marker for something that points 
        to corresponding @JsonBackReference, used when deserializing; does not 
        change serialization
      </li>
      <li>
        @JsonBackReference will suppress serialization, allow re-constructing 
        reference on deserialization
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      About only additional feature is that in case there are multiple link 
      references, it is possible to explicitly define id to use for matching 
      managed/back reference pairs. Note, too, that it is possible to use 
      self-references; this would be needed for nodes of doubly-linked lists 
      for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature is most useful for ORM beans, handling one-to-one and 
      one-to-many references, but is also useful for some cyclic data 
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.3 Mr Bean: Let Jackson do Monkey Coding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of more boring and mundane tasks with Java has traditionally been 
      the requirement to fully write out basic value holding Beans: adding 
      fields as well as getters and setters. Although Jackson has made it 
      possible to reduce need for such boilerplate code (for example, 
      eliminate need for setters by annotating private fields, or by using 
      @JsonCreator annotated constructors -- see the previous article about 
      Jackson with Immutable Objects!), more could still be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jackson 1.6 does that something. Consider following piece of code:
    </p>
    <pre>public interface Bean { // or could be an abstract class
  public String getName();
  public int getAge();
}

ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
// org.codehaus.jackson.mrbean.AbstractTypeMaterializer, extends org.codehaus.jackson.map.AbstractTypeResolver
<b>mapper.getDeserializationConfig().setAbstractTypeResolver(new AbstractTypeMaterializer());</b>
Bean value = mapper.readValue(&quot;{\&quot;name\&quot; : \&quot;Billy\&quot;, \&quot;age\&quot; : 28 }&quot;);</pre>
    <p>
      With earlier versions of Jackson (and with any other Java data binder), 
      what you would most likely get is an exception indicating problem of not 
      being able to create an instance of an interface. But thanks to that 
      AbstractTypeMaterializer thing, you can now <b>let Jackson materialize 
      bean classes</b> and relax.<br>Just remember to include that new 
      &quot;jackson-mrbean-1.6.0.jar&quot; (or Maven dependency) and you are good to go. 
      Pretty neat eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bean materialization works for simple interfaces and abstract classes: 
      methods recognized as setters and getters are implemented; other methods 
      either cause a failure, or can optionally be made to be implemented as 
      error-throwing placeholders. Appropriate setters are created if there 
      are getters (which is needed for cases like above) but if you want to 
      modify values yourself, you can also add explicit setter signatures. You 
      can also use all the usual Jackson annotations for configuration: since 
      type materializer is only concerned with creating classes, and does NOT 
      handle actual serialization or deserialization, standard Jackson 
      ObjectMapper will use them as before. Ability to define abstract classes 
      could be especially useful in cases where you want to control specific 
      aspects or properties, but leave simple properties to Mr Bean.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to write some more about Mr Bean in another article. And I would 
      especially appreciate feedback from users -- this has been the number 
      one missing feature (as per my own priorization) for almost 2 years now, 
      and I expect it to be a big hit, comparable to effect of mix-in 
      annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, big Thank You to Sunny G who contributed the initial version of 
      Mr Bean, so it could be included in 1.6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.4 Even More Extreme Performance: Project Smile, JSON-compatible 
      binary format</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And last but not least, another longer-term project that I have wanted 
      to do for a while is defining an efficient and 100% JSON compatible 
      binary format, similar to how various Binary XML formats have tackled 
      high-performance XML use cases. Although there have been prior attempts 
      at doing this (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON">BSON</a>), 
      none have been fully JSON compatible and performant (BSON for example is 
      neither super nor subset of JSON). Yet others insist on having to 
      specify rigid schema to use (Thrift, Protocol Buffers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Project Smile tackled this challenge, and produced what we hope to be a 
      very compelling binary data format, as well as full support for using 
      that data format exactly as one uses JSON. Sort of like just having 
      different representation of JSON. For those interested in low-level 
      details, feel free to check out <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonBinaryFormat">Smile 
      Data format specification</a> (and specifically if anyone is interested 
      in implementing Smile support on other platforms, PLEASE check it out!).
    </p>
    <p>
      To use Smile, all you need is to instantiate <b>org.codehaus.jackson.smile.SmileFactory</b> 
      (from<b> jackson-smile-1.6.0.jar</b>) -- which extends standard 
      org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory -- and use it as is (to create 
      SmileGenerators and SmileParsers; respectively extending JsonGenerator 
      and JsonParser), or via ObjectMapper (construct ObjectMapper with 
      SmileFactory). All the usual functionality should work as is, including 
      streaming parsing and generation, full data binding and Tree Model 
      access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious and measurable benefits include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More compact data -- especially so for larger and more repetitive 
        data, such as rows from database or entries for Map/Reduce tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Event faster parsing, and possibly faster generation (one of design 
        criteria was that generation speed is not sacrificed for parsing speed 
        or data size -- and hence Smile is one of fastest binary data formats 
        to write)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I hope to update <a href="http://wiki.github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/">Thrift-protobuf 
      performance benchmark</a> with Smile-based test results in near future: 
      based on measurements I have done so far (using locally modified 
      version), Smile is typically 25-50% faster and produces 25-50% more 
      compact data than Jackson with textual JSON. This makes it generally 
      faster than Thrift or Avro on Java (which are often no faster than 
      textual JSON with Jackson), and comparable in speed to Protocol Buffers 
      -- and all this without sacrificing any of Jackson flexibility or 
      expressive power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am specifically hoping to show how Smile would be a good alternative 
      to Avro for large-scale date processing; using optionally enabled 
      property name and String value back references, data size can be compact 
      enough to render schemas unnecessary; and turbo-charged Jackson parsing 
      and generation keep data flowing at wire speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will definitely write some more about Smile in future so stay tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Other significant areas of improvement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond &quot;big four&quot;, 1.6 includes numerous improvements and fixes (release 
      notes include 39 resolved Jira issues, mostly improvements and new 
      features).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.1 Enum value handling, customization</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Handling of enum values has been somewhat lacking prior to version 1.6. 
      With 1.6 it is finally possible to simply define that Enum.toString() is 
      to be used as serialization value (instead of Enum.name()) using 
      SerializationConfig.Feature.WRITE_ENUMS_USING_TO_STRING (and matching 
      DeserializationConfig.Feature.READ_ENUMS_USING_TO_STRING ). Or for 
      serialization, define serialization by existing @JsonValue annotation 
      that is now supported for Enum types; obvious case being to annotate 
      'toString()' with @JsonValue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to define &quot;Creator&quot; methods (aka factories) using 
      @JsonCreator annotation (constructors can not be used with Enums).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.2 More convenient Tree Model</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are numerous additions to Tree Model API 
      (org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode), such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        coercion of numeric types (JsonNode.getValueAsInt() and other 
        variants) to convert JSON String values
      </li>
      <li>
        JsonNode.has(String fieldName) for checking existence of a property
      </li>
      <li>
        set of findXxx() methods: JsonNode.findParent(), findParents(); 
        findPath(), findValue(), findValueAsText() (check out <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJavaDocs">Jackson 
        Javadocs</a> for details)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      which should simplify common Tree traversal tasks a lot. I probably 
      should write bit more about these methods in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.3 Serialization performance improvements</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although performance has always been a strong point of Jackson, there 
      was room for improvement on serialization side. With some tweaks, 
      serialization speed was increased by an average of 20% (as per 
      http://wiki.github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/ test). No configuration 
      changes are needed beyond upgrade to 1.6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.4 Allow registration of sub-types for Polymorphic Handling, without 
      annotations </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now possible to register subtypes for deserialization, instead of 
      having to use @JsonSubTypes annotation -- this was number one request 
      for improving polymorphic type handling. Registration is done using new <b>ObjectMapper.registerSubtypes()</b> 
      method(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.5 Better support for OpenContent using @JsonAnySetter and 
      @JsonAnyGetter</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although @JsonAnySetter annotation has been around since 1.0, to allow 
      binding unknown properties during deserialization, there wasn't anything 
      similar to serialize miscellaneous set of properties. But now you can 
      use @JsonAnyGetter to annotate a method that returns a Map with values; 
      which generally works nicely for things collected using @JsonAnySetter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.6 Yet More Powerful Generics Support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Jackson has always supported generic types reasonably well, 
      some advanced use cases (with type variable aliasing) could lead to 
      sub-optimal handling in 1.5. These have been improved with 1.6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. What Next?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably 1.7. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously though, there is no need for major backwards-incompatible 
      change (which would mean 2.0). But some obvious bigger areas for 
      improvements are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Better support for plug-in modules for third party datatypes -- this 
        has been planned for a while, and really needs to be done to help 
        further improve Jackson's support for all kinds of commonly used Java 
        datatypes. This also includes support for contextual 
        serializers/deserializers, ability to support per-property pluggable 
        (datatype-specific) annotations
      </li>
      <li>
        Support for fully cyclic data types, object identity. This is a rather 
        hard nut to crack, but something that is needed for complete Java 
        Object serialization support.
      </li>
      <li>
        JSONPath support, ideally at JsonParser level; possibly as filter for 
        materializing trees. This would be ideal for many large-scale data 
        processing operations
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewrite of annotation processing part to better support concept of 
        logical property accessed using various accessors (setter, getter 
        and/or direct field access)
      </li>
      <li>
        Advanced code generation for generating optimal 
        (as-fast-as-hand-written) serializers, deserializers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support for serializing as XML? (&quot;JAXB mini&quot;) -- although we promise 
        not to support weird automatic-mappings like Badgerfish, it is not out 
        of question that we might be able to support clean solid subset of 
        JAXB-style code-first serialization between POJOs and XML.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved support for values of non-Java runs-on-JVM languages; Scala, 
        Clojure, Groovy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Which of these get tackled depends on contributions, feedback from 
      users, and general fun-factor of working on adding things. So let your 
      voice be heard, be it via <a href="http://jackson-users.ning.com">Jackson 
      user group</a>, mailing lists or Jira voting.
