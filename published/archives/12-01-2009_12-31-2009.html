			<h3 class="entry-header">Upgrading from Woodstox 3.x to 4.0</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-size=3,font-style=,name=default,font-family=Tahoma,font-weight=normal,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      It has now been almost one year since <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_129.html">Woodstox 
      4.0 was released</a>.<br>Given this, it would be interesting to know how 
      many Woodstox users continue using older versions, and how many have 
      upgraded.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-size=3,font-style=,name=default,font-family=Tahoma,font-weight=normal,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      My guess (somewhat educated, too, based on bug reports and some 
      statistcs on Maven dependencies) is that adoption has been quite slow. I 
      think this is primarily due to 3 things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-size=3,font-style=,name=default,font-family=Tahoma,font-weight=normal,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
        Older versions work well, and fulfill all current needs of the user
      </li>
      <li>
        New functionality that 4.0 offers is not widely known, and/or is not 
        (currently!) needed
      </li>
      <li>
        There are concerns that because this is a major version upgrade, 
        upgrade might not go smoothly.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I can not argue against (1): Woodstox has been a rather solid product 
      since first official releases; and 3.2 in particular is a well-rounded 
      rock solid XML processor (if you are using an earlier version, however, 
      at least upgrade to latest 3.2 patch version, 3.2.9!).<br>And with 
      respect to (2), I have covered most important pieces of new 
      functionality, <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/09/entry_320.html">Typed 
      Access API</a> and <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2007/11/entry_53.html">Schema 
      Validation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so far I have not written anything about incompatible changes 
      between 3.2 and 4.0 versions. So let's rectify that omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Why Upgrade?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But first: maybe it is worth iterating couple of reasons why you might 
      want to upgrade at all:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You might want to validate XML documents you read or write against W3C 
        Schema (aka XML Schema). Earlier versions only allowed validating 
        against DTDs and Relax NG schemas
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to access typed content -- that is, numbers, XML qualified 
        names, even binary content, contained as XML text -- new Typed Access 
        API simplifies code a lot, and also makes it more efficient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Latest versions of useful helper libraries like <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/StaxMateHome">StaxMate</a> 
        require Woodstox 4.0 (StaxMate 2.0 needs 4.x, for example)
      </li>
      <li>
        No new development will be done for 3.2 branch; and eventually not 
        even bug fixes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Assuming you might want to upgrade, what possible issues could you face?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Backwards incompatible changes since 3.2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on my own experiences, there are few issues with upgrade. Although 
      the <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org/4.0.7/release-notes/COMPATIBILITY">official 
      list of incompatibilities</a> has a few entries, I have only really 
      noticed one class of things that tend to fail: Unit tests!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds bad? Actually, yes and no: no, because these are not real 
      failures (ones I have seen). And yes, since it means that you end up 
      fixing broken test code (extra overhead without tangible benefits). But 
      this is one of challenges with unit tests: fragility is often 
      desireable, but not always so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specific problem that I have seen multiple times is related to one 
      cosmetic aspect of XML: inclusion of white space with elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woodstox 3.2 used to output empty elements with &quot;extra&quot; white space, 
      like so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;empty /&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      but 4.0 will not add this white space:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;empty/&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      (this is a new feature as per <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX-125">WSTX-125</a> 
      Jira entry)
    </p>
    <p>
      and so some existing unit tests for systems I have worked on compare 
      literal XML for output tests. This is not optimal, but it is bit less 
      work than writing tests in more robust way, to check for logical (not 
      physical) equality. So whereas they formerly assume existence of such 
      white space, tests need to be modified not to expect it (or allow either 
      way).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Other challenges?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, I have not seen any actual problems, or other cosmetic 
      problems. But here are other changes that are most likely to cause 
      compatibility problems (refer to the full list mentioned earlier for 
      couple of changes that are much less likely to do so):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &quot;Default namespace&quot; and &quot;no prefix&quot; are now consistently reported as 
        empty Strings, not nulls (unless explicitly specified otherwise in 
        relevant Stax/Stax2 Javadocs). Usually this does not cause problems, 
        because Stax-dependant code has had to deal with inconsistencies with 
        other Stax implementations; but could cause problems if code is 
        expecting null.
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;IS_COALESCING&quot; was (accidentally) enabled for Woodstox versions prior 
        to 4.0. This was fixed for 4.0 (as per Stax specification), but it is 
        possible that some code was assuming on never getting partial text 
        segments (if developer was not aware of Stax allowing such splitting 
        of segment, similar to how SAX API does it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>4. Upgrade or not?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would recommend investigating upgrade; if for nothing else, because of 
      maintenance aspect. Pre-4.0 versions will not be actively maintained in 
      future. But it is good to be aware of what has changed, and of course 
      having good set of unit tests should guard against unexpected problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      And hey, it's soon 2010 -- Woodstox 3.2 is soooo 2008. :-)

<div class="entry" id="post-360">
			<h3 class="entry-header">How much does Free cost again?</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One of supposedly hard question is what is the actual cost of freedom of 
      speech. It can be debated endlessly, and is often considered priceless 
      (Mastercard trademarks not-with-standing). Hard question, sure, and 
      something I generally don't spend much time thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then again, sometimes it is rather easy to know the exact cost. Like 
      in case of my little blog: it is US$ 9.95.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      That ultra fancy commenting interface that you see next to entries (and 
      elaborate insanely complicated machinery that powers in in the backend), 
      provided by kind folks of Haloscan, has been free (of cost) so far. But 
      it was very recently brought to my attention that there is now a simple 
      choice for me, a happy user of said system, to make: I am free to either 
      (a) pay up (annual fee), or (b) &quot;vacate the premises&quot; (but with graceful 
      allowance of letting me keep stuff I brought along, i.e. export 
      comments!). What's not to like? What a delightful jule-time offer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Choice is bit tricky: on one hand, philosophically I do not object to 
      paying for services I use (or offer for others to use). But on the other 
      hand, I really REALLY dislike impression of a bait-and-switch scheme in 
      operation. Worse, given the short transition period -- unless I totally 
      missed earlier notices, just a couple of weeks -- makes this feel rather 
      rushed, &quot;an offer you can't refuse&quot;. So in many ways I do feel like just 
      taking my crap (no offense to respected authors of high-quality 
      commentary here) to someplace else. Perhaps even spending lotsa time 
      (which is money) to build a simple replacement for the system. Heck, I 
      have been paid to write such systems. Might as well do some pro bono 
      work for my own blog. But then again... I am lazy and time-constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      So: question is; is this dinky little commentary system worth 10 bucks a 
      year? Especially when advertising income from all the sidebar ads is 
      within that same order of magnitude, possibly less.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. Anyone know an actual free plug-in comment interface? Send me a note 
      if you do! (or if you must... leave a comment... but if so, before Jan 
      02, 2010 :-) )
    </p></p>

			<p><p>
      As has been reported earlier, Spring 3.0 (and Spring-json module, 
      specifically) now has a Jackson-based JSON view variant: see <a href="http://www.jroller.com/kaiulrich/entry/a_mappingjacksonjsonview_springframework_and_spring">MappingJacksonJsonView 
      and spring-json view comparison</a>. Comparison seems reasonable, 
      mentioning annotation-based configurability and performance as strong 
      points of jackson-based view.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 1.4: more control over writing JSON, improved interoperability</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
  First things first: if you haven't noticed yet, <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease14">Jackson 
  1.4.0</a> was just released.
</p>
<p>
  This release focuses mainly on writer (serialization) side, but there 
  are also continuing improvements to interoperability. I will review main 
  improvements below.
</p>
<p>
  <b>1. JSON generation improvements</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>1.1 Ignoring properties</b>
</p>
<p>
  A new annotation, <b>@JsonIgnoreProperties</b>, allows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
omitting serialization of listed properties:
<b>@JsonIgnoreProperties({ &quot;secretField&quot;, &quot;internalProperty&quot; })</b>;
listed properties will not be included in JSON output
  </li>
  <li>
omitting listed properties from being deserialized; if encountered 
they are just ignored even if there is a setter for them (regardless 
of whether setter is marked to be ignored or not)
  </li>
  <li>
ignoring all unknown properties for annotated class during 
deserialization (similar to disabling <i>DeserializationConfig.Feature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES</i>), 
but only affects instances of annotated class. This is done with 
property &quot;ignoreUnknown&quot;: <b>@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true)</b> 
(note: has no effect on serialization)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>1.2 JsonView</b>
</p>
<p>
  New @JsonView annotation allows defining logical views for 
  serialization: sets of properties to be written out for given view.
</p>
<p>
  Let's consider a simple example, where we want to control amount of 
  information written out, based on, say, user's credentials. To define 3 
  classes of properties, we can define views (more about identification 
  below):
</p>
<pre>  class Views { // container for View classes
static class Public { }
static class ExtendedPublic extends PublicView { }
static class Internal extends ExtendedPublicView { }
  }
  <br>And to define access levels for our info class, we would do<br>
  public class PersonalInformation { // Bean that uses Views to define subsets of properties to include
// Name is public
@JsonView(Views.Public.class) String name;
// Address semi-public
@JsonView(Views.ExtendPublic.class) Address address;
// SSN only for internal usage
@JsonView(Views.Internal.class) SocialSecNumber ssn;
  }  </pre>
<p>
  Given this set up, we would define View to use for serialization by:
</p>
<pre>  objectMapper.writeValueUsingView(out, infoInstance, Views.Public.class); // short-cut
  // or full version:
  objectMapper.getSerializationConfig().setSerializationView(Views.Public.class);
  objectMapper.writeValue(out, beanInstance); // will use active view set via Config
  // (note: can also pre-construct config object with 'mapper.copySerializationConfig'; reuse configuration)</pre>
<p>
  Which in this particular case would only contain &quot;name&quot; property. If we 
  had used view <i>Views.ExtendedPublic.class</i>, we would have gotten 2 
  fields; and with <i>Views.Internal.class</i>, all 3.
</p>
<p>
  Views are identified by classes: you can either create specific marker 
  classes, or use existing classes. Views use inheritance indicated by 
  class structure: such that a view is considered a sub-view of another 
  view if it extends that view. Child views include properties that parent 
  views include.
</p>
<p>
  For more description see <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJsonViews">JsonView 
  wiki page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>1.3 Ordering properties output</b>
</p>
<p>
  Another new annotation, @JsonPropertyOrder, allows defining complete and 
  partial field orderings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
You can define explicit ordering by listing properties as annotation 
value: <b>@JsonPropertyOrder({ &quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot; })</b> 
would ensure that &quot;id&quot; and &quot;name&quot; are output before any other 
properties during serialization
  </li>
  <li>
You can specify that anything not explicitly ordered will be output in 
alphabetic order: <b>@JsonPropertyOrder(alphabetic=true)</b>
  </li>
  <li>
Without these settings order is undefined because JVM does not expose 
order of underlying fields or methods (but see note below)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Beyond these definitions, 1.4 also guarantees that properties used with <b>@JsonCreator</b> 
  annotations (constructors, factories) are serialized before other 
  properties, unless there are explicitly ordered properties (which will 
  have priority). This change was to optimize @JsonCreator property usage: 
  ideally these properties should be readable before other properties -- 
  although JSON logical model does not provide for such guarantee, Jackson 
  will try to do its best to make ordering optimal.
</p>
<p>
  <b>2. Interoperability improvements</b>
</p>
<p>
  Goal of interoperability improvement is to make Jackson a &quot;universal&quot; 
  JSON data binding tool on JVM. That is: we hope to make Jackson usable 
  from other JVM languages, not just Java -- already one can use it from 
  quite a few (reported to work from Groovy, Clojure), and hopefully 
  supporting others like Scala in near future (Scala lists are not well 
  handled, yet) -- as well as interoperate nicely with most common data 
  libraries.
</p>
<p>
  To this end, there is now default support (i.e. no need for custom 
  converters or mix-in annotations) for following data types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
DOM (xml) trees: properties declared as DOM Document, Element and Node 
will now be properly serialized to, and deserialized from JSON 
Strings. Useful if you want to embed XML as JSON properties (sometimes 
good for interoperability)
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda</a> DateTime type, 
and mechanism to easily add more types as needed (file a <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JACKSON">Jira</a> 
request if you need more!)
  </li>
  <li>
Handling of <b>javax.xml</b> types that some platforms lack (Android 
and GAE have had some issues) much improved so that they are 
dynamically and reliably added, if underlying types are present.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Last point should also make it yet easier to make Jackson run on new 
  &quot;subset platforms&quot;; containers that support subset of JDK 1.5 (or have 
  issues with some parts).
</p>
<p>
  <b>3. Plans for 1.5</b>
</p>
<p>
  So what next? 1.4 release can be thought of a &quot;minor&quot; minor release, 
  similar to 1.3; compared to fundamentally new functionality of 1.2 
  (mix-in annotations, JsonCreators), 1.3 and 1.4 have consisted of 
  smaller (but more numerous) evolutionary incremental improvements. In 
  many ways, Jackson releases have mirror JDK releases, come to think of 
  that.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway: the next Big Thing will be &quot;<a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization">Polymorphic 
  Deserialization</a>&quot;, which is by far the most requested feature. That 
  is, ability to deserialize instances of correct types, even in absence 
  of static type information (declared type of, say, List&lt;Object&gt; could 
  still be deserialized to contain whatever actual type of serialized 
  instance was). Getting this done is important in itself, but the most 
  important aspect in my mind is to Do It Right. This should not be a 
  stop-gap solution, or something to rewrite in near future. It should be 
  comprehensive, flexible and robust solution to the non-trivial problem. 
  And plan is to do just that; now that other queued blocking issues (like 
  that of finall getting much-requested JsonView done) have been dealt 
  with.

      It is an unfortunate fact of life that &quot;news&quot; services in US are in 
      sorry, tepid state; and to get decent news coverage one has to use 
      better international sources (BBC, or any european agency), or turn to 
      non-daily/non-TV alternatives (magazines, which still offer reasonable 
      in-depth coverage). But this on-going idiotic episode with a celebrity 
      golf player's domestic issues takes the cake as the low point for this 
      decade (maybe competing with media's criticless bashing of UN Iraq 
      nuclear inspectors back in 2002 -- but I digress)<b>.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What could POSSIBLY be more important issue?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But hey, there have been recent orgies of lesser relevant news (did 
      Michael Jackson's or Ann-Nicole Smith's deaths really warrant being top 
      news entries). Why is this any different? Aside from being even less 
      relevant -- honestly, gossip pages, or perhaps sports section (... which 
      is ridiculously inflated part of local newspapers and TV programmes, 
      anyway...) would have been better placements; and for respectable 
      publications, possibly not even those -- than anything comparable in 
      recent history, there is the thing that there has actually been lots of 
      newsworthy things to write about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like, say, that gathering of world leaders in Copenhagen; discussing 
      urgent (and eventually life-and-death) matters of saving the world. And 
      in domestic section, well, there's plenty of economic stuff to write 
      about, or the thing about medical industry and insurance. Oh, and hey, 
      wasn't there a war of sizable portions also going on (actually, two, but 
      who's counting).
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, I can't think of a reason for this even ranking on page 7 of 
      thursday edition of the local newspaper. There are tabloids, after all, 
      that could cover this stuff. Well, except that in US, it's not 
      &quot;newspapers vs tabloids&quot;; it's mainstream (tabloid level) and fringes 
      (&quot;news of the world&quot;). Even mainstream sells manufactured controversies 
      (trademark of tabloid in other countries) and social porn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, somehow what irritates me most is that I noticed that CNN 
      followed up on this stupid episode like a hawk; as if it really was a 
      major story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. What did that &quot;N&quot; originally mean? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So why pick on CNN? After all, CNN is to News what MTV is to Music -- 
      sad, irrelevant misnomer. Ted Turner would be rolling in his grave was 
      he not alive. I guess it has more to do with the fact that CNN is 
      ostensibly in the news business. Newspapers and most other networks are 
      in general &quot;media&quot; business; they are also News dilettantes, spewing 
      some amateur-level newsy stuff. But clearly TV networks are more into 
      general entertainment; and newspapers into advertising with some 
      commentary columns (well, actually, they also do do some local news 
      stuff -- useful and sometimes noteworthy -- maybe I am being too harsh 
      --  but only local, seldom even reaching to regional level).
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's that when even entities that claim to do News fail to do that, 
      well, that's pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Message to mr. Woods</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok; enough ranting about sad state of US media. But here's a personal 
      message for the nominal cause of this red herring of a news: Tiger, go 
      stuff that golf club up your ass. Sideways. I don't care about your 
      business (personal or otherwise) -- but it appears that your messy 
      business has suddenly become my business. Stop it. Go, disappear. And 
      for crying out loud, don't cry out loud in public. It is so pathetically 
      unmanly that I feel nauseous. So, grow a spine (a pair you apparently 
      already have). Whatever else you do, do NOT cause more media events. You 
      are rich enough to afford to do whatever that other stupid athlete did 
      after murdering his wife (of hey, yeah, come to think of that, do not do 
      what that guy did in the end -- just the initial part of trying to keep 
      low profile).

<div class="entry" id="post-353">
			<h3 class="entry-header">On good, efficient data formats</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      There are 2 fairly recent additions to category of &quot;good binary data 
      formats that work nice with Java&quot; category: <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/11/02/avro-a-format-for-big-data/">Avro</a> 
      and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kryo/">Kryo</a>. I have meant to 
      write something about both for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Avro</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Avro is a simple and efficient general-purpose data format, developed as 
      part of Hadoop project. Due to its background, it should work very well 
      with Hadoop (and map/reduce systems in general). It is also quite 
      similar to what I had been thinking of implementing for my own (well, my 
      employer's, rather) large-scale data processing needs, when there was no 
      Avro. From my shallow understanding of Avro, it seems to nicely fit the 
      bill for data format for huge sequence of records; but with 
      self-describing property that is sadly lacking from other contestants 
      like Google's protobuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will hopefully have some more tangible notes to add in future: for now 
      it's enough to note that Avro's performance seems to be pretty good, at 
      least in the &quot;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/thrift-protobuf-compare/wiki/Benchmarking">thrift-protobuf</a>&quot; 
      benchmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Kryo</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly speaking Kryo is not a data format, but rather Java object 
      serialization framework that happens to define a data format to handle 
      its main task. But since sending POJOs back and forth over the wire is a 
      very common (perhaps the most common) task for data formats, in Java 
      world, this is not a big difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      First thing I noticed was its good performance (on above-mentioned 
      benchmark). This is nice, since there is already JDK default 
      serialization that performs adequately for most tasks; so anything else 
      that does binary serialization should be able to meet and beat that 
      performance baseline, to be of interest. But as importantly, API seems 
      straight-forward, simple, and adequately customizable.<br>So I have 
      reasonably high expectations for this library -- it could be nice 
      complement to something like, say, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dirmi/">Dirmi</a> 
      (RMI alternative for JDK default one -- should be coupled with 
      alternative, similarly improved, serialization mechanism, n'est pas?).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Disclaimer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, I have not made up compelling use case for using these two 
      projects, yet. But given promise they hold, I should be able to test 
      them out come next year.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">More Jackson adoption: Mule/iBeans</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      As per <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/using-json-bindings-with-ibeans/">this 
      announcement</a>, Mule is another major framework that has officially 
      adopted Jackson for its JSON processing needs (&quot;first we take JAX-RS... 
      then we take ESB!&quot;). That should be good for everyone involved. And more 
      work for the development, polishing and fixing things that new flow of 
      users brings in; as well as plenty more exposure for the project &amp; 
      processor.<br>That should keep the project honest, relevant, and 
      hopefully producing diamond(s) -- without high pressure, all you'd have 
      would be lump of coal. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sort of related note; the latest tally of number of contributors 
      (individuals named on 'release-notes/CREDITS') is 50. Not too shabby -- 
      Jackson will pretty soon bypass Woodstox in most regards (see an<a href="/blog/archives/2008/04/entry_62.html">earlier 
      blog entry</a> for context); probably not by LOC, but in most other 
      measures.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Classic Android, with Electric Sheep</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Yes, best pop and rock music, as well as sci-fi books seem to have been 
      written in (late) 60s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Case in point: Philip K Dick's classic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F">&quot;Do 
      Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;</a>. What an absolute 
      masterpiece. Very prescient, relevant, and fundamentally deep; all 
      without seemingly trying too hard to be anything more than a decent 
      story. None of wanna-be-intellectual babble -- smart with dead-on style; 
      or trying to predict future -- it is enough to just reflect on reality, 
      observations of human mind, and there you have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I originally read this book about 10 years ago, but as a translation (in 
      finnish). It made a big impression even then -- even more so than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">the 
      movie</a> that was based on it (movie is pretty good too, but book is 
      just so much much better... this even though I read book only after 
      seeing the movie, usually &quot;first one wins&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      So: few months back I noticed a paperback english copy at the local book 
      store (no, I don't order all my books online...) and decided to re-read 
      it. Was it still good? Not just good, absolutely positively great. So if 
      you like sci-fi but have somehow managed not to read it, go read it. 
      Same applies to most (or perhaps all) books by PKD of course; like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle">The 
      Man in The High Castle</a>, (written in -62), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch">The 
      Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</a> (-65) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik">Ubik</a> 
      (-69)... the list goes on and on. And even though his later works are 
      very good too (like, say, VALIS and The Transmigration of Timothy 
      Archer, his last book), it's something about those books from 60s that 
      has the absolute brilliant genius. Or, shall we say, &quot;shine of crazy 
      diamons&quot; (I know, I know, that's refecence to a great 70s song... but 
      YEARLY 70s, not that far removed). I just wish he had had a chance to 
      write just some more books. Yes, they are that good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and just in case you are wondering: his 50s books are strikingly 
      good too. :-)<br>I love &quot;The World Jones Made&quot; for example. Totally cool 
      book, which somehow manages to mix in strong environmentalist themes 
      (about 20-30 years before anyone else did, it seems), extension of 
      pan-Gaia, and of course plenty of dark humor and bit of political 
      commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given above, I concur that I am bit of a fan boy. Now, maybe I should 
      get Kindle for Christmas, to be able to read more...
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">JSON data binding performance (again!): Jackson / Google-gson / JSON Tools... and FlexJSON too</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (note: this is a follow-up on an <a href="/blog/archives/2009/09/entry_326.html">earlier 
      measurements</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. A New Contestant: FlexJson</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After realizing that <a href="http://flexjson.sourceforge.net/">FlexJson</a> 
      is actually capable of both serialization and deserialization (somehow I 
      thought it would only serialize things), I decided to add it as the 
      fourth contestant in the &quot;full service Java/JSON data binding&quot; category 
      of tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially I was bit discouraged to find that it makes one rookie 
      mistake: assumes that somehow JSON comes in (and goes out) as Java 
      Strings. But aside from this glitch, package actually looks quite solid 
      -- and its exclusion/inclusion mechanism looks interesting. Maybe not 
      exactly my cup of joe (if it was, after all, Jackson API would look more 
      like it does), but a viable alternative. And I can see how ability to 
      prevent deep copy would come in handy sometimes. And finally, some of 
      the features actually exceed what Jackson can currently do, regarding 
      polymorphic deserialization (since FJ includes class name by default, I 
      assume it can do it) and some level of cyclic-dependency handling 
      (ignoring serialization of cyclic references at least).
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's see how &quot;rookie&quot; (yes, I know, it's not exactly a new package, 
      just new addition to the test) fares...
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Test setup</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tests are run using nice Japex performance test framework, running on my 
      somewhat old AMD work station (~1700 Ghz Athlon -- someone needs to 
      click on those right-hand-side ads to get me a new performance-testing 
      work station! :-) ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Input data used consists of serialization of tabular data (database 
      dump, good old &quot;db100.xml&quot; used by countless xml tests), converted to 
      Java POJOs, and then to individual data formats (here as JSON, but can 
      be tested as XML and whatnot). Document size is 20k in XML, and slightly 
      less in JSON (about 16k). It would be easy to run using other data sets, 
      but in the past, performance ratios for 2k, 20k and 200k documents have 
      not had radical differences, so 20k one seems like a reasonable choice 
      (but note that the earlier benchmark did in fact use 2k documents, so 
      actual numbers do differ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Test project itself, &quot;StaxBind&quot; is still in Woodstox SVN repository, 
      accessible via Codehaus SVN page. (one of these days I should just 
      create a Github project -- but not today).
    </p>
    <p>
      Versions of JSON processing packages are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Jackson 1.2.0
      </li>
      <li>
        Google-gson 1.4
      </li>
      <li>
        Json-tools-core 1.7
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexjson-1.9.1
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Code for each library is using default settings, and using what appears 
      as the most efficient interface, for cases where transformations are 
      from byte streams on server side (byte streams in, byte streams out).
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to represent results is by showing performance ratios, using 
      the slowest implementation as base line (TPS == transactions per second; 
      number of times a 20k document is read, written, or both):
    </p>
    <p>
      (note: Jackson/manual is omitted since it is hand-written (if simple) 
      serializer/deserializer, and there are no direct counterparts for other 
      packages -- while it would give even bigger faster-than-thou ratio, it 
      wouldn't be a fair comparison)

      So looks like our &quot;new kid on the block&quot; manages to outperform the other 
      two non-Jackson JSON processors here. And at least get within an 
      order-of-magnitude with Jackson... :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Musings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So it turns out that despite its interfacing (those String/byte 
      conversions), Flexjson package manages to work more efficiently than 
      some other packages that claim &quot;simplicity and performance&quot;. And this 
      without actually claiming to be particularly performant, but rather 
      focusing on design of API and ease-of-use aspects. Pretty neat, I 
      respect that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Next?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My current main interest (with respect to performance issues) lie in the 
      area of compressing data for transfer: after all, most of the time there 
      is relative abundance of CPU power compared to available network and I/O 
      bandwidth. This means that trading some CPU (needed for compression and 
      decompression) seems like a bargain for many use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the other hand, <a href="/blog/archives/2009/05/entry_263.html">as 
      we saw earlier</a>, the question is &quot;how much is too much&quot;. And that's 
      where my new favorite simple-and-fast algorithm, LZF, comes in. But 
      that's a different story.
    </p></p>

      Ok, looks like I managed to hit the target I set up recently, to write 
      &quot;one hundred and one&quot; blog entries this year. Granted, this was not a 
      giant stretch of literal muscle, given that at the time I had already 
      gone most of the way. Nonetheless it is good to hit the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there's still some time to go until New Year, I think I might as 
      well target the next even number, 111 entries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned...

      By now, <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome">Jackson</a> is 
      becoming widely-known for its lightning-fast streaming JSON parser, as 
      well as for its powerful, intuitive and efficient data binding 
      functionality. But wait! There is more!
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">

      Has this ever happened to you? You need an array of ints, and all you 
      got is this dingy little List of Strings (representing numbers)! You 
      would think JVM, as smart as it is, could quickly whip up a conversion 
      to &quot;do the needful&quot;... but no. In fact, even simpler conversions like 
      number to/from String, String to/from boolean, Sets to/from Lists and so 
      on are irritating: easy to solve, sure, but with too much monkey code.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      And don't even get me started on other conversions between encodings 
      like base64 to byte arrays; dumping Object fields as Maps; or building 
      Objects from Maps (possibly read from properties files). There are tons 
      of simple tasks that should be made even simpler.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      <b>2. What if..</b>.

    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Ok, now: let's round up some facts related to POJO serialization and 
      Jackson:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
        Jackson is great at serializing all kinds of Java objects as JSON
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson is awesome at deserializing JSON into Java objects
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      So: what if... say... you serialized, List&lt;String&gt; into JSON and... 
      lessee... deserialized it back to.... int[]... what would happen? 
      Conversion! (as long as Strings indeed contain numbers -- if not, what 
      would happen is an exception of some kind)
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Ah! I see, so, you are saying that <b>serialize+deserialize == conversion</b>! 
      Like:
    </p>
    <pre>  //ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(myStringList);
  int[] intArray = mapper.readValue(json, int[].class);</pre>
    <p>
      Presto!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Jackson 1.3 gets it</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With version 1.3, there is something that simplifies above procedure by 
      50%:
    </p>
    <pre>  int[] intArray = mapper.convertValue(myStringList, int[].class);</pre>
    <p>
      (yes, you should have seen that one coming)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.1. Conversions: Basic types</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Primitive type conversions obviously work:
    </p>
    <pre>  Boolean b = mapper.convertValue(&quot;true&quot;, Boolean.class);<br>  Date d = mapper.convertValue(&quot;2009-10-10T12:00:00.00+0800&quot;);</pre>
    <p>
      although are not exactly any shorter than equivalent idioms you would 
      use. But they serve as basis for other conversions, for Lists, Maps and 
      arrays of primitives and wrappers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.2. Conversions: Containers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, containers with various content types work as expected:
    </p>
    <pre>  ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; ints = mapper.convertValue(new Object[] { 13, &quot;1&quot;, Integer.valueOf(3) });<br>  Set&lt;String&gt; uniq = mapper.convertValue(new String[] { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot; }); // would produce set with 2 entries</pre>
    <p>
      <b>3.3. Conversions Base64&lt;-&gt;binary</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you want to encode binary data, you can do:
    </p>
    <pre>  String encoded = mapper.convertValue(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });<br>  byte[] decoded = mapper.convertValue(encoded, byte[].class);<br>(usually reading from a File or such)</pre>
    <p>
      <b>3.4. Beans to Maps and back</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can also convert simple Java beans (or more generally 
      POJOs) into Maps or JSON trees:
    </p>
    <pre>  Map fieldMap = mapper.convertValue(myBean, Map.class);<br>  MyBean bean = mapper.convertValue(fieldMap, MyBean.class);<br>  // or read from properties file<br>  Properties props = new Properties();<br>  props.load(new FileInputStream(file));<br>  MyBean bean2 = mapper.convertValue(props, MyBean.class);<br>  // and can convert to a JSON tree as well:<br>  JsonNode rootNode = mapper.convertValue(bean2);<br></pre>
    <p>
      And you can obviously configure bean types with annotations (regular and 
      mix-in annotations) as you like, as necessary for conversion you want to 
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neat stuff, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. What does this have to do with JSON?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Good question. Nothing, really. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      That is: there is no requirement for the intermediate JSON generation; 
      and in fact, for future Jackson versions, there will be improvements to 
      allow use efficient intermediate data structure for these conversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And conveivably one could even refactor functionality into separate bean 
      conversion package, if conversions are widely used without actual JSON 
      processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Got better use cases?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope someone out there can come up with even better examples of this 
      power. If so, let me know!
    </p>
    <p>
      One area that I hope to improve upon is that of converting <i>java.util.Properties</i> 
      into POJOs. Although sample above works, it does not deal with naming 
      convention of &quot;refField.anotherField.field = 3&quot;, which is one natural 
      way to represented nested structures. It should be made to work; just 
      needs little bit of name mangling; especially when trying to handle 
      arrays and lists (&quot;object.listField.4 = abx&quot;).
    </p></p>

      Ok, in between technical time, it's time to review some goofy stuff 
      while we wait for Santa. Here goes...
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Can't manage to find time to do something useful..</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      yet have plenty of time for &quot;time management&quot;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound silly? Have a look at <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro 
      Technique</a>. Great for giggles, as a case study for human insanity.<br>But 
      if it starts to make some sense at any point, do not hesitate to get 
      some professional help. Immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again, there are always some co-workers who might benefit 
      others by such techniques: by not having time to do anything, they could 
      not make mistakes. And that's worth something too (brakes for loose 
      cannons).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>update</b>: above comments are just related for application of said 
      technique(s) to software development -- maybe other domains could 
      benefit from intrusive regularly-scheduled interruptions (perhaps 
      augmented by electrical shocks)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. IRC? Yes, that thing hackers use when they don't want to be 
      overheard!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, you can always trust <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ">Numb3rs</a> 
      to get technical things FUBAR. Funny stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you will excuse me, I will have to disconnect from my blog 
      server before connection can be traced by FBI (it's that 30 second rule 
      you may know from movies -- must triangulate fast -- gotta go!)
