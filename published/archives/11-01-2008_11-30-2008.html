			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson: on with the show, 0.9.4 is here!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
  In honor of all the fallen tasty turkeys, the Jackson Project team is 
  proud to present release 0.9.4 of <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson 
  json processor</a>. While not as much to be thankful about as the 
  forthcoming 1.0 release candidate, this is nonetheless a significant 
  upgrade (I call it a &quot;mop-up version&quot;), and upgrading is strongly 
  recommended for all users.
</p>
<p>
  This new version has following things going for it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Simple yet elegant way of adding support for new on/off features 
(using enums <b>JsonParser.Feature</b> and <b>JsonGenerator.Feature</b>)
  </li>
  <li>
Optional support for non-standard Json comments (c and c++ style), requested by many users.
  </li>
  <li>
Clear definitions of if and when parsers/generators close the 
underlying streams/readers/writers, as well as matching feature (<b>JsonParser.Feature.AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE</b> 
and <b>JsonGenerator.Feature.AUTO_CLOSE_TARGET</b>) to further force 
specific behavior
  </li>
  <li>
Copy-through methods added to JsonGenerator, which allow for 
single-call copying of single source events, as well as full sub-trees 
(Object/Array with all the contents)
  </li>
  <li>
Efficient and versatile Base64 content write support for JsonGenerator 
(versatile meaning that couple of non-standard variants, such 
&quot;MODIFIED-FOR-URL&quot; are also supported, easy to add more
  </li>
  <li>
Jars now double as OSGi bundles, full metadata added to run on OSGi 
containers (briefly tested with Felix CLI)
  </li>
  <li>
Vastly improved (professional strength) unit test suite (code coverage 
at around 70% and going up)
  </li>
  <li>
A few bug fixes, many resulting from extensive testing: found problems 
mostly related to UTF-8 decoding issues
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As usual, check out the <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/0.9.4/release-notes/VERSION">release 
  notes</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
  And then on to the forward-looking statements. This release was 
  specifically focused on clearing up the most pressing feature requests 
  and bug fixes, so that the last significant thing to add for 1.0 -- data 
  binding for Java beans -- can be added. So the next thing to rewrite 
  will be &quot;java type&quot; mapping, so that it will support mapping data to and 
  from regular Java beans, similar to <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a> 
  or <a href="http://jaxb.dev.java.net">JAXB</a> (although with much more 
  limited feature set and configurability). As usual past performance is 
  no guarantee of future etc etc, hold your breath at your own risk.

<div class="entry" id="post-96">
			<h3 class="entry-header">Woodstox: first Release Candidate for 4.0.0 (aka "Woodstox-core-3.9.9-1")</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      It has been quite a while -- the last major Woodstox release (3.0) was 
      two years ago, and the minor one (3.2) almost a year ago. But now the 
      First Release Candidate of Woodstox 4.0.0 is finally out. It is 
      versioned as 3.9.9-1 to try to make it easier to use versioning 
      facilities of Maven and OSGi bundle resolution (i.e. to avoid these 
      messing up operation when 4.0.0 finally arrives)
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is new with 4.0.0? Here are the major things that come to mind 
      (for the rest, check out release notes)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Typed Access API</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already mentioned Typed Access API a few times, since I think it 
      is The Thing with Woodstox 4.0. To quickly recap features, it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Supports reasonable subset of Schema datatypes: Scalars (booleans, 
        ints, long, doubles, QNames), arrays (space-separated ints, longs, 
        doubles) and Binary (base64, with variants including &quot;URL-modified&quot;)
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports reading and writing o
      </li>
      <li>
        element content and attribute
      </li>
      <li>
        and does all of above Conveniently AND Efficiently
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My hope is that this will be a real boon for data binding; as well as 
      providing alternative for MIME-attachment - based binary data passing. 
      With Woodstox 4.0 you should be able to embed binary data 
      efficiently(-enough) to forgo other workarounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typed Access API is now integral part of Stax2 API, as of version 3.0.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>W3C Schema Validation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Schema validation, well, it has been coming for a while. I suspect 
      many users find it useful; and there have also been some improvements to 
      existing validation support (DTD, RelaxNG) as a result of adding Schema 
      validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>OSGi support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a> support is another 
      things that I am actually quite excited about: OSGi is a great idea in 
      itself, and I am happy that now Woodstox will support it explicitly and 
      hopefully well. OSGi support includes post-processing of bundled MSV 
      jars as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stax2 API (v3.0.0) with bundled Reference Implementation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stax2 API has been improved a lot since Woodstox 3.2 (which bundled 
      Stax2 api v2.0.0). For Woodstox 4.0, Stax2 API is provided as a 
      full-featured stand-alone OSGi-enabled reusable artifact. And it also 
      comes with fairly extensive Reference Implementation, which allows for 
      easy/easier implementation of Stax2 by other Stax implementations. <a href="http://staxmate.codehaus.org">StaxMate</a> 
      project, for example, will use it to provide Stax2 adapters that wrap 
      regular Stax 1.0 implementations to offer significant subset of Stax2 
      functionality. And the Ultra-High-Performance Stax implementation called <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/hatchery/aalto/index.html">Aalto</a> 
      will use Stax2 RI to get a fully-featured Stax Event API implementation 
      essentially for free.<b>
</b>    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Interoperability Improvements</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to easier implementation of Stax2 API (which should foster 
      interoperability between Stax implementations) via Stax2 RI, DOM 
      interoperability has also been significantly improved. 
      Namespace-repairing mode works well, text coalescing mode is implemented 
      as well as the Typed Access API methods. Unit test coverage has been 
      upgraded to be comparable to testing of &quot;native&quot; Stax parser/writer 
      functionality, for basic use cases. So you might even consider using 
      Stax2-on-DOM just to be able to access typed data conveniently via Stax2 
      Typed Access API.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Internal Cleanup</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally Woodstox-4.0 has been significantly refactored: lots of 
      unnecessary legacy code was killed, some moved to Stax2 RI, and Javadoc 
      comments should be much improved. Also, the baseline JDK requirement was 
      lifted from 1.2 to 1.4 (which enabled some of the cleanup). This should 
      not be a huge change as most users have hopefully migrated to 1.4 and 
      beyond by now. For Woodstox 5.0 baseline will move at least to 1.5, to 
      be able to use Enums, and just a little bit of generics, but for now 1.4 
      will work fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Anything Else?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above is just the overview, of course -- there are dozens of other 
      visible improvements (check the release notes), as well as significant 
      internal cleanup and refactoring, which should make 4.0 
      well-maintainable and allow for further improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I am excited about upcoming 4.0.0 release. Especially, if 
      you ever work with actual typed non-textual data (which should be true 
      for most common Woodstox use cases), you really should try out the Typed 
      Access API. You will like the way that works.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... and now I will be off to start work on StaxMate-2.0.0 which will 
      make good use of Stax2 API v3.0.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay 7un3d!
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">First Week at the New Gig</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      After departing from my previous place of employment last week, this was 
      my first week at the new job, at a Company Whose Name Shall Not Be Used 
      in Blogs (... restriction that may or may not be part of my employment 
      contract -- but check out my LinkedIn page if you want to know more). 
      Yay! Let's hear if for the Change One Can Believe In.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is definitely just the honeymoon period -- and hence all 
      comparisons would be biased and pointless -- I do like the change of 
      pace a lot so far. After extreme complexities at the World's Biggest 
      On-line Retailer (where domain truly is utterly complicated, due to both 
      essential complexity and additional overhead), it is delightful to be 
      able to harbor illusions of possibly understanding end-to-end picture at 
      the new place. There are obviously many systems to consider, but 
      platforms, languages and packages in use are so much more familiar and 
      mainstream than last time I had start from square 1. It is still easy to 
      see purpose of each and every cog of the clockwork; as well as have easy 
      (enough) initial ideas regarding how to build new things and resolve 
      existing problems. And although I have yet to locate a single instance 
      of wstx-3.2.4.jar or such, components seem reasonably up-to-date, and 
      having been chosen quite sensibly. About the only scarily complicated 
      thing seems to be the best practices of using the source control 
      management system (which is more complicated than I have seen in other 
      places, much less than used myself).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the coolest thing is that potentially I might get to work on two of 
      my top areas-of-generic-interest: large-scale/high-through web services 
      and IR-based technologies (and that's about the extent I can talk about 
      those things -- just that there is something of interest over there). 
      Assuming I can get enough focus this could lead to something 
      interesting, cool AND valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I have great expectations for this new beginning.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">The Concession Speech</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (for context, check out <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/11/entry_93.html">this 
      posting</a>, and if reading long after November 2008, US history news 
      for November 4th, 2008)
    </p>
    <p>
      I have ALWAYS wanted to give a concession speech (heck: I'd settle for 
      an acceptance speech if I had to). So now is the perfect opportunity to 
      mash up one for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. for anyone who wouldn't otherwise spot it, please note that I am 
      using the most sincere form of flattery -- you should be able to 
      identify the original speech quite easily: no, I am not that eloquent. 
      Great speech, very glad to have heard it. And apologies for my crude 
      attempts at crafting relevant overrides.

    <p>
      <b>Concession Speech by sw. eng. Also Known As CowtownCoder, I-WA</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for reading through this 
      email on this rainy cold Seattle day.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends, we have -- we have come to the end of a long journey. The 
      Pager has beeped, and it has beeped loud and clear. A little while ago, 
      I had the honor of lunching with my manager and team mates, fellow 
      Amazonians -- and to inform them -- &quot;of my decision to pursue other 
      opportunities&quot; (AUDIENCE: boo! boo!) -- please -- in this great city 
      that we all love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an employment as long and demanding as this one has been, my peers' 
      success alone commands my respect for their abilities and perseverance. 
      But that they have managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many 
      other Amazonians who had once wrongly believed that they had little at 
      stake or little influence in the affairs of this company is something I 
      deeply admire and commend them for achieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognize the special significance this holiday season will have for 
      all Amazonians and I envy the special pride that must be theirs this 
      year. I've always believed that Amazon offers opportunities to all who 
      have the industry and will to seize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let there be no reason now -- let there be no reason now for any 
      Amazonian to fail to cherish their continued employment in this, the 
      greatest company around Seattle International District.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is natural -- it's natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but 
      come Monday you must move beyond it and work together to get Christmas 
      shippings moving again. We fought -- we fought as hard as we could. But 
      customers just keep on coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though I fell short of the 4 year employment goal, the loss is mine, 
      not yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of working 
      alongside, for comraderie and for all you have done for me. I can even 
      forgive having had to learn how to use Brazil version sets, if you give 
      me enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am especially grateful to my family for their continued support of my 
      gainful employment. You know, employments are often harder on an 
      employee's family than on the employee, and that's been true in this 
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I can offer in compensation is money I received for my RSUs, and the 
      expire Bus Pass from 2007. But absolutely no promise of peaceful years 
      ahead. (AUDIENCE: laughter)
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDIENCE: (Chanting) Bezos! Bezos!
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not -- I would not be an -- an Amazonian worthy of the name, 
      should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege 
      of serving this company for almost four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDIENCE: (Chanting) S3! Prime membership! Kindle! Mechanical Turk!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but 
      love for this company and for all its employees, whether they supported 
      cool new and tried-out working ideas or suffered from severe case of NIH 
      syndrome. I wish Godspeed to everyone remaining committed to writing and 
      demanding writing of high-quality code, no matter what the obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I call on all Amazonians, as I have often during my time there, to 
      not despair of our present difficulties but to believe always in the 
      promise and greatness of Amazon, because nothing is inevitable here. Not 
      even mandatory use of bloated proprietary data formats instead of open 
      standard ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazonians never quit (except for me). We never surrender. We never hide 
      from history, we make history. And have Fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you, and may the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless you! And Amazon 
      too! Thank you all very much. Do not forget to tip the waitress! No, I 
      will not be here next week!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you, you are all too kind. No I mean seriously. You are. Go home 
      now!
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">My Last day at Amazon</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      This is a bittersweet week in many ways. Today I left Amazon.com after 
      about 900 work days (and couple of on-call nights).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is natural to have mixed feelings after spending multiple years doing 
      something specific: I had my Amazon interviews around time of the US 
      presidential elections of 2004, and now left after that particular 
      national nightmare finally ended. On positive side, at least I did not 
      leave a legacy behind...
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazon is one of those places that you just love to hate (&quot;can't live 
      with it, can't live without&quot;). For those that are not familiar with 
      Amazon.com the software company, it is a place of extremes: fundamental 
      insights mixed with sizable stupidities and (often baseless) arrogance, 
      massive raw talent and potential greased with misguided cultural legacy 
      (frugality as in cheap, &quot;just do it&quot; attitude abbreviated as NIH, and so 
      on). So you could say that it is blessed with lots of good people and 
      cursed by habits that some of the very same people have developed over 
      time. I won't go into gory details: if you have ever worked there you 
      know what I mean; and if not I might not be able to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond being exciting and frustrating place of highest degree, 
      Amazon is Unique. Few places can offer the scale and scalability 
      problems to tackle. Very few. Most companies just try solving all 
      problems by the Standard Hammer: big-ass relational database, running on 
      colossal servers. Not so at Amazon, for both better and worse. And if we 
      are lucky, uncannily smart folks from Amazon Web Services will soon 
      offer us with vastly extended set of good scalable building blocks that 
      will finally obsolete many of these worn relics from 70s, such as 
      relational databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what it all means is that it's such a trip to work there for a while 
      -- try it and you'll feel like having drank multiple Pan-Galactic Gargle 
      Blasters, on your way to Mars and back. So I thoroughly recommend trying 
      it out, if you are young and have no history of heart problems. Heck: 
      even WITH heart problems it might be worth it (&quot;what doesn't kill you 
      makes you stronger&quot;?). No pain no gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how do I <i>really</i> feel now? Perhaps like David Bowie put it: 
      &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; is close. But be sure to check 
      out the next blog entry here for another perspective.
