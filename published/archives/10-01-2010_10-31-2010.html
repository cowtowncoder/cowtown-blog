			<h3 class="entry-header">Faster compression on Java platform with LZF</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One open source project that I have worked on a bit lately is <a href="http://github.com/ning/compress">compress-lzf</a>, 
      a simple Java library that implements block- and stream-accessible 
      version of LZF compression algorithm. LZF algorithm itself is very 
      simple, and mostly (only?) documented <a href="http://oldhome.schmorp.de/marc/liblzf.html">here</a>, 
      in form of working reference implementation that doubles as 
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our implementation is a simple rewrite of C version, and fully 
      compatible with the reference implementation including file header and 
      block signature (this is different from the other existing Java version 
      that projects like H2 include). While simple implementation, it is not 
      naive translation; and some effort has been spent on optimizing its 
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as should be the case for such low-level libraries, there are no 
      external dependencies beyond JDK 1.5; meaning it should work on variety 
      of platforms, including Android (in fact it could probably be compiled 
      on any 1.x JDK)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is LZF?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      LZF compression algorithm is basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel_Ziv">Lempel-Ziv</a>, 
      with little additional processing; so one way to think of it is that it 
      is &quot;gzip without Huffman encoding&quot; (gzip uses Deflate, which is 
      Lempel-Ziv followed by Huffman encoding, with variable bit-length).<br>And 
      Lempel-Ziv is just method whereby one finds repeating sub-sequences in 
      output, replacing sequences of three or more &quot;already seen bytes&quot; with a 
      back-reference; matches are typically stored in a hash table indexed by 
      hash of first 3 bytes, value being offset of last instance of 
      potentially matching sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that many other similar (and sometimes similarly 
      named) algoritms likewise use basic LZ; &quot;Fastlz&quot; for example is very 
      similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Gzip exists, why bother with LZF?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But why does this matter? If gzip is this and more, why would you want 
      to use a &quot;lesser&quot; algorithm?
    </p>
    <p>
      Key benefit is that of speed: LZF can be up to twice as fast to 
      uncompress; but where it REALLY shines is compression speed -- here it 
      can be 2x or 3x as fast (writing a stand-alone benchmark is on my todo 
      list, so hopefully I will get to talk a bit more about this in future). 
      Performance difference is mostly due to relatively high overhead that 
      deflate uses for non-byte-aligned output (which is needed for optimal 
      Huffman-encoding of codewords) -- while it definitely helps compression, 
      it is expensive in terms of CPU usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      LZF compression rate is lower than with gzip, but compression profile is 
      similar: things that compress well with gzip also compress well with 
      LZF; and those that compress less do so with LZF as well. This makes 
      sense given that most compression often comes from LZ algorithm, which 
      is implemented similarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it all comes down to this: gzip compression is very CPU-intensive 
      (read: slow); so much so that you typically use 5x as long to compress 
      things like JSON data than writing content itself. With fast networks 
      and I/O this often becomes bottleneck.<br>LZF can be a good alternative 
      since its CPU overhead is much more modest; and it can still compress 
      &quot;fluffy&quot; content pretty well -- where gzip can compress something by, 
      say, 90%, LZF usually gets to 75-80% ratio (this obviously varies by 
      types of content; basically depends on which part of deflate algorithm 
      is more effective)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Usage</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that above sounds interesting, you can get compress-lzf library 
      either from GitHub; or via Maven. In latter case, information is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.ning&lt;/groupId&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;artifactId&gt;compress-lzf&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        current version at time of this writing is &quot;0.6.0&quot;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And from there you can use class from <i>com.ning.compress.lzf</i> 
      package:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        LZF is a simple command-line utility you can use for manual 
        compression/uncompression (jar defines this class as the Main-Class so 
        you can just invoke it with &quot;java -jar compress-lzf.jar&quot; to get usage 
        information)
      </li>
      <li>
        LZFInputStream and LZFOutputStream are compressing input (read LZF 
        compressed data) and output (write LZF compressed data) streams, 
        similar to JDK's GZIPInputStream and GZIPOutputStream
      </li>
      <li>
        LZFEncoder and LZFDecoder are block-based codecs that can be used to 
        encode (compress) and decode (uncompress) chunks (byte[]) of data
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both streaming and block-based interfaces have their uses; for example, 
      when storing BLOBs in database, block API works better; and when reading 
      data over network or from filesystem, streams make more sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.1 Note: avoid LZFOutputStream.flush() (&quot;just let it float...&quot;)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One note on LZFOutputStream: be careful with flush()ing -- just like 
      other block compressors (including gzip), LZF can only do 
      back-references within single block; and since LZFOutputStream.flush() 
      forces closing of an open block, it can dramatically reduce compression 
      rate. As such it is best to avoid flush()ing if at all possible, unless 
      you actually want to create a logical boundary at some point.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Future plans for the library</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      While there are always improvements for any Open Source projects, I 
      think the natural scope for LZF library is quite small. Similar to <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JugHome">Java 
      Uuid Generator</a>, it is quite possible that there won't be need for 
      major changes to implementation or API; which means that future 
      improvements are most likely in areas of integration; helping other 
      projects use LZF.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, given unique CPU/io/bandwidth trade-off LZF can offer, it 
      could make a really nice component for large-scale data transfer and 
      processing, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data processing with map/reduce (Hadoop)
      </li>
      <li>
        Data storage (with frameworks like jDBI, Hibernate; or with NoSQL 
        projects like Voldemort, Cassandra)
      </li>
      <li>
        Data aggregation (logging, log processing, Scribe)
      </li>
      <li>
        Caching: use LFZ with memcached?
      </li>
      <li>
        Combination of high-performance data formats (Jackson Smile, binary 
        JSON serialization) and compression -- can be combined with other use 
        cases too.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So it will be interesting to see where things go in near future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. On benefits of working for a company that is comfortable with Open 
      Source</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike with many earlier Open Source projects that I have worked on, 
      much of work that went into this open source library was done on company 
      time. It also was a team effort (Jon wrote the streaming handling, I 
      wrote block codec); compared to most other open source projects where I 
      have been the main author. So I have come a long way, having worked for 
      a semi-OS-hostile company, then a bit for a neutral (agnostic?) company; 
      and now working for one hat is actually engaged with community (Ning). 
      And I must admit that I really like that Ning is openly committed to 
      working with open source projects, not just using open source artifacts 
      others make. This is not solely meant as an ad for Ning (although we are 
      indeed hiring...), I just think it is important to give credit where it 
      is due.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this, <a href="https://github.com/organizations/ning">Ning section</a> 
      at Github already has some public projects, and there are literally a 
      dozen more being cleaned up to be ready for publishing. Within just a 
      few more months I think Ning will be more recognized for its 
      contributions in Open Source space; and eventually become a signifant 
      player. I see this as a major benefit, making it bit less difficult to 
      hire the best developers; and especially so for a company that is still 
      relatively small, and thus having less name recognition than the big 
      boys.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Java Pearls: case-insensitive Map?</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Here's one more thing I did not know until very recently: how to get a 
      Map with String keys that allows case-insensitive access? Or, 
      case-insensitive membership checks. One typical use case is to handle 
      case-insensitive entities such as names of HTML tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      One obvious way to do this is to canonicalize keys by lower-casing (or 
      upper-casing) keys both when inserted and when doing lookups. But this 
      is actually not the only way to do this: there is a very simple 
      JDK-provided alternative:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>  Map&lt;String,Object&gt; tags = new TreeMap&lt;String,Object&gt;<br>    (String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      and that's it; you can access values with any combination of casing. 
      Similarly you can also create TreeSets for basic inclusion checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this is something that most Java developers know and I had just 
      somehow missed. But if not, here it is in case you happen to need such 
      access.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. For what it's worth, the main reason I had missed this being a 
      possibility was that I always thought comparator given to TreeMap and 
      TreeSet would only be used for ordering. But thinking about it a bit 
      more, this makes more sense; since comparisons must be done anyway (to 
      find location of an entry to find or insert), why not use &quot;equals&quot; 
      return value of comparator for something.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">More on Java UUID Generator (JUG), a word on performance</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Ok, so Java UUID Generator version 3 is out. Beyond question of what is 
      new with this version (which I outlined in the <a href="/blog/archives/2010/10/entry_426.html">previous 
      entry</a>), the next asked was &quot;how is performance?&quot;.<br>My 
      first thought was that it should be about the same as what version 2.0 
      has; but after some more thinking I realized that this is not a very 
      useful answer to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I wrote a simple micro-benchmark to find out (it's in 
      'src/main/java/perf/MeasurePerformance.java') more about performance 
      aspects. Test uses three main generation methods (random-, time- and 
      name-based) for JUG, and matching alternatives that <b>java.util.UUID</b> 
      has (random- and limited named-based variant).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Performance of UUID generation, general observations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      High-level summary would be:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Performance between equivalent methods between JDK and JUG have 
        similar performance (no surprise) -- JDK just does not provide 
        time-based variant (one most commonly used by non-Java systems); nor 
        ability to configure Random-based variant
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance between three main generation types varies <b>a lot</b>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>2. Actual numbers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So how big are differences? Here is actual snapshot from running the 
      test on my MacBook: each run generates 250,000 UUIDs, and time taken 
      (after test ran for about a minute) is reported as milliseconds:
    </p>
    <pre>  Test 'JDK, random' -&gt; 974 msecs
  Test 'JDK, name' -&gt; 230 msecs
  Test 'Jug, SecureRandom' -&gt; 971 msecs
  Test 'Jug, java.util.Random' -&gt; 33 msecs
  Test 'Jug, time-based' -&gt; 39 msecs 
  Test 'Jug, name-based' -&gt; 256 msecs</pre>
    <p>
      Since these values fluctuate a bit, exact values are not as important as 
      ratios. Random-based variants are slowest for both implementations 
      (except for case of using 'java.util.Random' -- more on this in a bit); 
      name-hash (MD5 by default; SHA-1 available with Jug too) methods are bit 
      faster; and time/location-based variant is rather fast, close to 50% of 
      maximum theoretical per-node generation rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So generation rates for this system would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Random-based method (using SecureRandom) generates about <b>250k UUIDs 
        per second</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Name-based variant (MD5) without namespace is almost 4 times as fast, 
        generating about <b>1 million UUIDs per second</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Time-based variant (Ethernet address plus timestamp) is much faster -- 
        almost <b>20 times as fast</b> as Random-based default variant -- 
        generating about <b>5 million UUIDs per second.</b> This is also close 
        to theoretical maximum rate for the method, which is 10 million UUIDs 
        per second (sustained), because timestamp granularity (100 
        nanoseconds) prevents higher throughput (to work around this, one can 
        generate parallel generators using different Ethernet address)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Quite a difference! It is worth noting, too, that speed of name-based 
      method is related to both existence of namespace (this test did not use 
      one; adding one slows things down slightly) and length of name used; 
      latter because hash is calculated on name used. And finally, hash method 
      used also matters (SHA-1 is slower than MD5).
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is up with the random variant? And didn't I forget one 
      impressive number from my analysis above?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Why is Random-based generation so slow?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Constructing &quot;secure&quot; pseudo-random numbers is not easy, and this is the 
      main reason for slowness. Looking at stack traces, it looks like JDK <i>java.security.SecureRandom</i> 
      actually uses random device provided by the underlying operating system; 
      and this is part of the slowness (due to use of JNI). But generation 
      itself is fundamentally slow, even if no system calls were needed. It is 
      quite possible that faster machines might not even speed up performance 
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Couldn't we just use 'java.util.Random' to speed things up?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the &quot;secure&quot; (i.e. &quot;good&quot;, meaning one providing good level of 
      randomness) variant is slow, couldn't we use a faster one? Like 
      &quot;java.util.Random&quot;? In fact, didn't numbers above show using it 
      resulting in version as fast as using time-based variant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, this is possible: and JUG allows you to pass any java.util.Random 
      instance you want (it just defaults to SecureRandom).<br>But speed is 
      not everything: the main point of UUIDs is the uniqueness, and this is 
      why SecureRandom is used as the default by both JUG and JDK. And while 
      the default pseudo-random number generator that java.util.Random uses is 
      fine for many uses, I am not sure I would trust its simple algorithm for 
      generating UUIDs; even if initialized using system clock 
      (System.currentTimeMillis()). The underlying algorithm just does not 
      have any actual source of randomness beyond initial seed value and I do 
      not trust that its random number distribution, then, is good enough to 
      give strong guarantees of uniqueness (I would love pointers to someone 
      discussing actual measurements or research on this!).
    </p>
    <p>
      So to me downgrading to using simple text-book pseudo-number algorithms 
      does not seem tempting, even if it speeds things up by an order of 
      magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. So what would make more sense?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, looking at numbers, how about consider time-based variant? 
      Name-based variant is not quite as useful; not so much due to 
      performance aspects, but since it actually requires you to hand source 
      of uniqueness (name to hash).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Thoughts on relevance of above </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was bit surprised by how big the difference actually is. But whether 
      it really matters depends on use case -- oftentimes you don't need even 
      thousands of UUIDs per second (most services can not really serve even 
      one thousands requests per second), so the rate of a quarter million per 
      second is just fine. After all, it only takes about four microseconds 
      (on average) to generate one UUID.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are use cases where this matters more; especially if UUIDs are 
      used liberally, for example using UUIDs as identifiers for all business 
      objects generated during processing.<br>So if your use case truly 
      depends on (or at least benefits from) fast generation of UUIDs, you 
      probably want to use time-based generation method from Jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. How did I do that again?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok; since I haven't yet gotten Javadocs set up, here is the way to 
      generate time-based UUIDs.
    </p>
    <pre>  // need to pass Ethernet address; can either use real one (shown here)
  EthernetAddress nic = EthernetAddress.fromInterface();
  // or bogus which would be gotten with: EthernetAddress.constructMulticastAddress()
  TimeBasedGenerator uuidGenerator = Generators.timeBasedGenerator(nic);
  // also: we don't specify synchronizer, getting an intra-JVM syncer; there is
  // also external file-locking-based synchronizer if multiple JVMs run JUG
  UUID uuid = uuidGenerator.generate();</pre>
    <p>
      And that's it. Other variants are generated similarly, by creating 
      generator instance with <i>Generators</i> factory.
    </p></p>

<div class="entry" id="post-426">
			<h3 class="entry-header">Something new, something rather old: Java Uuid Generator, version 3.0</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      As briefly mention in the previous blog entry, <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JugHome">Java 
      Uuid Generator</a> version 3.0 was <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JugDownload">just 
      released</a>. For those who do not know it, JUG is my first widely used 
      Open Source library, dating to something like 2002; written when JDK 1.1 
      was still the bee's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 3.0 is just a bit of refurbishing (2.0 was released almost 5 
      years ago), and no new functionality was added.<br>But it's good cleanup 
      still, achieving following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Move to using standard java.util.UUID (which came with JDK 1.4) for 
        better interoperability
      </li>
      <li>
        Build jar as an OSGi bundle (it has no dependencies, no big deal)
      </li>
      <li>
        Deploy to Maven repos (using Sonatype OSS repository), use Maven for 
        build as well
      </li>
      <li>
        Better API: instead of a global static singleton UUIDGenerator, 
        construct generator instances (for different methods)
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplified synchronization (generators are fully synchronized)
      </li>
      <li>
        Offer access to Ethernet address (MAC address) without native code, 
        using JDK 1.6 method '<b>NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress()</b>'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Obvious downside is that API did change, so existing code that uses JUG 
      2.0 will not work as is. But since classes are now in package 
      &quot;com.fasterxml.uuid&quot;), it is possible for both versions to co-exist. 3.0 
      will also require JDK 1.4 (2.0 could run on 1.1); or 1.6 if Ethernet 
      address access functionality is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, if you are using JUG 2.0, update probably makes sense and should 
      be easy to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. Why use JUG over java.util.UUID? JDK version can only generate 
      random-number based UUIDs and convert from bytes to UUIDs (or vice 
      versa) -- JUG can generate other variants (name-based, time/location 
      based).
    </p></p>

<div class="entry" id="post-424">
			<h3 class="entry-header">Look back on "prioritizing Open Source projects" (from May 2010)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      It has been more than 4 months since I wrote about my experiences with <a href="/blog/archives/2010/05/entry_400.html">priorization 
      for Open Source projects</a>, it seems like good time to see how things 
      have been moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks like there are two ways to look at things -- whether glass is half 
      full or half empty -- as I have pretty much completed 50% of tasks; but 
      not necessarily in order of priority. And this even thought I publicly 
      outlined priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One positive thing is that the top entry (Java UUID Generator 3.) was 
      just completed; and the second entry (Woodstox 4.1) is nicely in 
      progress, to be completed within a month or two. On the other hand, 
      other two completed tasks (both related to Jackson 1.6 that was 
      completed a month ago) were entries listed as having the lowest 
      priority. Some entries not on the list were also completed; specifically 
      work with <a href="http://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client">Async 
      HTTP Client</a> and OAuth signature calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess I think this is reasonable outcome, as priority lists for my 
      &quot;hobby&quot; development are there to help and assist, not to drive to 
      specific business goals or to rein in my creativity. So even more 
      important than getting things done in &quot;right order&quot; is that things do 
      get done. So as long as more important or more urgent things are more 
      likely to get worked on than less important or urgent things, overall 
      efficiency remains brutally high, which is the way I like it. Finally, 
      part of the reason for fluctuating order of execution is due to some 
      tasks being more interesting than others; and working on &quot;most 
      interesting&quot; things tends to maximize amount of progress (in contrasts 
      to working on less interesting but more highly prioritized things).
    </p>
    <p>
      But to get some closure on this entry, let's consider this a completed 
      4-month Scrum and create an updated priority list. Here's what it might 
      look like:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Complete Woodstox 4.1 (XML Schema, other user requested features) -- 
        carry-over from the original list
      </li>
      <li>
        Aalto 1.0: finalize async API, implementation
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson 1.7: focus on extensibility (module registration, contextual 
        serializers)
      </li>
      <li>
        ClassMate (1.0?) -- library for fully resolving generic types; based 
        on Jackson code
      </li>
      <li>
        External version of Mr Bean (from Jackson 1.6)
      </li>
      <li>
        StaxMate 2.1? (from the original list)
      </li>
      <li>
        Tr13 1.0? (from the original list)
      </li>
      <li>
        ... and then re-consider
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is an incomplete list and I expect roughly similar completion rate 
      if I was to look back again in 4 months. Maybe I should start doing 
      quarterly project reviews just for fun. :-)
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson tips: overriding serializer or type for Map keys, values, Collection/List values</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      I have only recently realized that much of <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome">Jackson</a> 
      functionality is a unknown to most users. Part of unawareness is due to 
      lack of documentation; but even though <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonDocumentation">documentation</a> 
      has arguably been improving over time (at least <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJavaDocs">Javadocs</a> 
      and rest of FasterXML wiki), there are limits to what can be achieved by 
      feature-listing style of documentation. To add supporting documentation, 
      then, I am trying to write bit more about both specific features that 
      could use more spotlight, as well as more how-to style explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's start with something reasonably simple that is not universally 
      known by Jackson users (this is actually based on my answer to one 
      expert user):
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jackson Tip of 21-Oct-2010: annotations for overriding 
      deserialization settings of Collection and Map properties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say that you have bean like this:
    </p>
    <pre>class Bean {
  public List&lt;Object&gt; values;
}  </pre>
    <p>
      where you want to deserialize List entries as type 'ValueBean'. To 
      specify type of 'values' property itself you could use annotation <b>@JsonDeserialize.as</b>; 
      but this can not be used to define content type (since annotation values 
      can not be generic types, only classes). So how do you do specify 
      deserialization type of List values (or Map values)? One possibility 
      would be specifying a custom deserializer, but that would be an overkill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is actually simple enough: there is another @JsonDeserialize property 
      to use for this use case:
    </p>
    <pre><font face="monospaced">class Bean {
  @JsonDeserialize(contentAs=ValueBean.class)
  public List&lt;Object&gt; values;
}</font></pre>
    <p>
      which also works for Map values (for Map keys you would use 
      @JsonDeserialize.keyAs).
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, you can explicitly specify deserializer to use for keys and 
      values using <b>@JsonDeserialize.contentUsing</b> and <b>@JsonDeserialize.keyUsing</b> 
      instead of basic <b>@JsonDeserialize.using</b> which is used for the 
      property itself:
    </p>
    <pre><font face="monospaced">class Bean {
  @JsonDeserialize(contentUsing=ValueBeanDeserializer.class)
  public List&lt;Object&gt; values;
}</font></pre></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Lazy Coder Cuisine: Balsamic Sausage Chunks (aka Venetian Sausage Bites)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (note: I decided to use title prefix &quot;Lazy Coder Cuisine&quot; to make it 
      easier to find food/drink recipes from the Blog -- who knows, maybe it 
      could even lead to a virtual cook book over time!)
    </p>
    <p>
      On my quest to find recipes with exceptionally high value/effort ratio, 
      I came across this gem. It is basically a very simple snack, offering 
      good taste (if non-stellar looks) with modest effort. To give credit 
      where it is due I found the source recipe (<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/michael-chiarello/venetian-sausage-bites-recipe/index.html">Venetian 
      Sausage Bites)</a> at Food Network web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basic idea is very simple:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take sausage -- uncooked sweet italian sasusage suggested (whatever is 
        convenient package; 6 sausages recommended)
      </li>
      <li>
        Poach (cook in boiling water) for a bit (6 - 7 minutes); slice into 
        bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry slightly on skillet, using as much olive oil as necessary (like 2 
        table spoons) to get bit of color, firm texture
      </li>
      <li>
        Add balsamic vinegar (1 cup; more if you want more sauce), simmer to 
        reduce into syrupy sauce (15 - 20 minutes or s)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And the result is a very tasty cocktail snack, in about half an hour 
      (and probably less if you are in a hurry). Results have interesting 
      looks, charcoal black, which is bit acquired taste; but taste itself has 
      broader appeal I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait! There is room for further simplification (as well as for 
      variation) here. For one, you can just use cooked sausage (and obviously 
      vary different kinds), which gets rid of the second step. And if you 
      like bit of additional fat and salt, feel free not to discard melted fat 
      after step 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is actually kind of cool how flexible balsamic vinegar is; 
      considering how different resulting reduction tastes compared to source 
      material. Plus it is probably easy to further pimp the recipe -- I bet 
      adding bit of cream could not hurt the sauce... maybe even add something 
      like apple sauce for added hint of sweetness (best sauce for ham, for 
      example, adds mustard, cream and apple sauce on fat melted from ham... 
      and maybe dash of pepper).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main consideration here is just what to serve these with, if 
      anything. As cocktail snacks, can definitely serve them stand-alone. But 
      other typical companions of sausages should work well too (serve with 
      scrambled eggs?).
    </p></p>
