     <h3 class="entry-header">Basic flaw with most binary formats: missing identifiable prefix (protobuf, Thrift, BSON, Avro, MsgPack)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Ok: I admit that I have many reservations regarding many existing binary 
      data formats; and this is major reason why I worked on <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormat">Smile 
      format</a> specification -- to develop a format that tries to address 
      various deficiencies I have observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the full list of grievances would be long, I realized today 
      that there is one basic design problem that is common to pretty much all 
      formats -- at least Thrift, protobuf, BSON and MsgPack -- that is: lack 
      of any kind of reliable, identifiable prefix. Commonly used techniques 
      like &quot;magic number&quot;, which is used to allow reliable type detection for 
      things like image formats appears unknown to binary data format 
      designers. This is a shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. The Problem</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a piece of data (file, web resource), one important piece of 
      metadata is its structure. While this is often available explicitly from 
      the context, this is not always the case; and even if it could be added 
      there are benefits to being able to automatically detect type: this can 
      significantly simplify systems, or to extend functionality by accepting 
      multiple kinds of formats. Various graphics programs, for example, can 
      operate on different image storage formats, without necessarily having 
      any metadata available beyond just actual data.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why does this matter? It helps in verifying basic correctness of 
      interacton in many cases: if you can detect what is and what is not 
      valid piece of data in a format, life is much easier: you have a chance 
      to know immediately when piece of data is completely corrupt, or you are 
      being fed data in some format than the one you expect. Or, if you 
      support multiple formats, you can add automatic handling of differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Textual formats do it well</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But let's go back to commonly used textual data formats: XML and JSON. 
      Of these, XML specifies &quot;xml declaration&quot; which can be used to not only 
      determine text encoding (UTF-8 etc) used but also the fact that data is 
      XML. It is cleanly designed and is simple to implement. As if it was 
      designed by people who knew what they were doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JSON does not define such a prefix, but specification does specify exact 
      rules for detecting valid JSON, as well as encodings that can be used; 
      so in practice JSON auto-detection is as easy to implement as that for 
      XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. But most new binary formats don't</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now; the task of defining unique (enough) header for binary formats 
      would be even easier than that for textual formats, because structurally 
      there is less variance: no need to allow variable text encoding, 
      arbitrary white spaces, or other lexical sugar. It took me very little 
      time to figure out the simple schema used by Smile to indicate its type 
      (which in itself was inspired by design of PNG image format, an example 
      of very good data format design).
    </p>
    <p>
      So you might think that binary formats would excel in this area. 
      Unfortunately, you would be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I can see, following binary data formats have little or no 
      support for type detection:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Thrift</b> does not seem to have type identifier at its format 
        layer. There is actually small amount of metadata at RPC level (there 
        is a message-start structure of some kind), but this only helps if you 
        want/need to use Thrift's RPC layer. Another odd things is that 
        internal API actually exposes hooks that would be used to handle any 
        type idenfitiers; it is as if designers were at least aware of 
        possibility of using some markers to enclose main-level data entities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>protobuf</b> does not seem to have anything to allow type detection 
        of a given blob of protobuf data. I guess protobuf never claimed to be 
        useful for anything beyond tightly coupled low-level system 
        integration (although some clueless companies are apparently using it 
        for data storage... which just plain old Bad Idea), so maybe I could 
        buy argument that this is just not needed, that there is never any 
        &quot;arbitrary protobuf data&quot; around. Still... adding a tiny bit of 
        redundancy would make sense for diagnostics purposes; and given that 
        protobuf already has some redundancy (field ids, instead of using 
        ordering) it would seem acceptable to use first 2 or 4 bytes for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MsgPack</b> and <b>BSON</b> both just define &quot;raw&quot; encoding, 
        without any format identifier that I can see. This is especially 
        puzzling since unlike protobuf and Thrift, they do not require a 
        schema to be used; that is, they have plenty of other metadata (types, 
        names of struct members; even length prefixes). So make these data 
        formats completely  unidentifiable?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>4. But what about Avro?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one exception aside from Smile, however. Avro seems to do the 
      right thing (as far as I can read <a href="http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.4.1/spec.html">the 
      specification</a>) -- at least when explicitly storing Avro data in a 
      file (I assume including map/reduce use cases, stored in HDFS): there is 
      a simple prefix to use, as well as requirement to store the schema used. 
      This makes sense, since my biggest concern with formats like protobuf 
      and Thrift is that being &quot;schema-ridden&quot;, data without schema is all but 
      useless. Requiring that two are bundled -- when stored -- makes sense; 
      optimizations can be used for transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Avro definitely seems better design than 4 other binary data formats 
      listed above in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Why do I care?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of my on-going expansion of Jackson (&quot;the universal data 
      processor&quot;), I am thinking of adding many more backends (to support 
      reading and writing data in alternate data formats), to allow clean and 
      efficient data binding to/from most any commonly used data formats. 
      Ideally this would include binary data formats. Current plans are to 
      include format detection functionality in such a way that new codecs can 
      detect data they are capable of reading and writing; and this will work 
      just fine for most existing formats that Jackson can handle (JSON, 
      Smile, XML). I also assumed that since it would be very easy to design 
      data formats that can be reliably detected, existing formats should be a 
      piece of cake to detect. It is only when I started digging into details 
      of binary data formats that the sad reality sunk in...
    </p>
    <p>
      On plus side, this makes it easier to focus on adding first rate support 
      for data formats that are easy to detect. So I will probably prioritize 
      Avro compatibility significantly higher than others; and I will 
      unfortunately have to downgrade my work on adding Thrift support which 
      would otherwise be the most important &quot;alien&quot; format to support (due to 
      existing use by infrastructure I am working on).

      Ok, another minor but important change that just occured is that at 
      present there is unfortunately no way to comment on my writing style, 
      content, or anything else, on this blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe it or not this not due my sensitive skin or low self-esteem. It 
      is actually due to surprising sticker shock I got when looking into 
      actual cost of continuing with my formerly-free comment-extension 
      provider. As I mentioned earlier, I am not against paying for things I 
      use; and I can also get over immediate knee-jerk reaction to what may 
      appear as bait-n-switch. So it is not about unwillingness to pay. But I 
      am not willing to pay more for simple comment extension than I pay for 
      hosting the whole thing (including shell access, plenty of storage and 
      transfer space) -- this just does not seem like a reasonable value 
      proposition. As a rough estimate of what I would pay, suitable price 
      should be something similar to lowest fee one has to pay for a custom 
      social network at Ning (20$ / year). That I would be ok with.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, until I figure out suitable replacement, you will just have to bite 
      your tongue, or send comments directly to me (both of which you are 
      welcome to do! :-) ).<br>

    <p>
      ps. If your comment would be about a free commenting system I could use, 
      please do send it to me -- contact info is available via link next to 
      &quot;About me&quot;.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Welcome HP, So Long Dell (and don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      (warning: this is another rant. Sorry!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's another improvement in my daily life: after more than a year of 
      space-shuttle-lift-off noise, short-but-brutish uptimes, and countless 
      curses, family's lean old Dell XP &quot;work&quot;station is out for good. Its 
      only agreeable attribute was its slim neat looks (and sort of neat 
      mechanism used for case, allowing its easy opening -- too bad there's 
      not much to do even if you can open it easily). Good riddance, music to 
      my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The replacement, HP Pavilion Slimline, actually looks every bit as good 
      as its predecessor. But otherwise the two are polar opposites: new box 
      is quiet, as reliable as expected (i.e., &quot;just works&quot;), and its only 
      design flaw is that it comes with an OS written by a company based in 
      Redmond. But that I can live with, since it's not my work machine. :-)<br>And 
      even Windows seems to have improved a bit between versions (new one has 
      Windows 7, previous one whatever preceded Vista).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: I just thought I'll share my distaste with Dell products (maybe 
      I should actually include &quot;not-so-good&quot; lists on my semi-professional 
      home page?) now that I am getting rid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all started couple of years ago, when I decided to stop wasting my 
      time on building my own PCs from components (which made sense after 
      college, could save some money). I figured that with time I spent 
      building PCs, and then troubleshooting problems with components,  it 
      just didn't make a whole lot of sense. And so I thought I'd go with 
      something that other customers in general had found usable: back then 
      Dell had highest customer ratings of all PC companies; and save for one 
      friend of mine (who had already fought with Dell's phone &quot;support&quot; 
      people, due to problems with memory chips that were failing; and that no 
      amount of rebooting would ever fix), I wasn't aware of huge problems 
      with the company or its products.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I found out by experience makes me suspect that the company that 
      had gotten good reviews had been abducted by aliens, and replaced by an 
      ersatz replica or something. Correlation between happy customers and 
      company that produced crap I bought just is not there. I am not talking 
      about customer support (no point calling them wrt. badly designed piece 
      of hardware, IMO, it is not not something a script-reading underpaid 
      remote helper can help a lot with), but rather about quality of 
      hardware. My experience beyond PC fiasco was that their products are 
      competitively priced, but have low quality. For example, laser printer 
      that I bought to replace trusty old Apple writer (which, after having 
      bought second hand, served us for 8 years; for total lifetime of 
      probably 15 years; and would have worked well but I couldn't find new 
      toner cartridges for reasonable prices any more!) was inexpensive, and 
      worked fine for a while. Like, maybe a year. And then broke down. The 
      only thing left are LCD monitors, which I have to admit were reasonably 
      priced, and still work. In fact both are still in active use. So I guess 
      they do produce something other than lemons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about that last sentence: I guess I could put my feelings into 
      fitting slogan: <b>Dell -- General Motors of Computers</b>.<br>Feel free 
      to quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. I am happy to admit that after kicking that incompetent CEO of 
      theirs out, HP seems to have done nice comeback. Good for them, and us.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Fool's Gold, Standard(s)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Here's something new: some <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/02/22/frum.ron.paul.gold/index.html?hpt=Mid">good 
      reading</a> (&quot;Ron Paul's money plan is far from golden&quot;) at CNN (sic!): 
      this time about nostalgic folly of returning to the &quot;gold standard&quot;. It 
      is surprising that someone whose intellectual aspirations are bit above 
      those of his supporters (ok, granted, that's a low bar), one would be so 
      mistaken about realities of tying national currency into amount of 
      precious metal(s) central bank physically has. Maybe this is why central 
      banks are generally lead by people with economic education and 
      experience, and not physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean, yes, from laymanperspective, it would seem nice if that green 
      paper that gets printed on would actually have collateral. But 
      impracticality of full collateralization should be obvious: you don't 
      need much of a thought-exercise to see how and why it would fail; and 
      from that point on, to backtrack and see why this realization (when 
      shared by people who control flow of money) means that attempt would be 
      a self-fulfilling failure. And if we were unlucky, slowly cooking but 
      colossal-cluster-magnitude failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the great depression that is obviusly mentioned in the 
      articles, proponents of &quot;strong currency&quot; managed to starve millions of 
      people to death during late 1800s. I am most familiar with a somewhat 
      starvations in Finland (there were 2 instances): globally speaking these 
      were just blimps on radar (sice the whole country population was barely 
      in millions), but death rate from starvation actually exceeded that of 
      world wars... and all that so that central bank could protect value of 
      currency, by not loaning money (or subsidize seeds), managing to keep 
      central bank in black, and peasants hungry or dead. Famine was orginally 
      triggered by weather, of course, but the catastrophe could have been 
      averted by government action. And in similar vain, in more recent 
      memory, depression of early 90s (in Finland) was also deepened by later 
      crop of strong currency proponents, who tried (ultimately in vain) to 
      keep the currency strong by trying to avoid devaluation. In the end they 
      had to let it float anyway (causing run-off devaluation by something 
      like 30% in a week), but so late that much of damage was already done. 
      Fortunately no one starved to death on account of this failure, although 
      unemployment rate tripled closer to 20%.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure there are many more examples; and some EU countries are 
      currently experiencing related challenges (now that they are forced to 
      exercise certain discipline after screwing up their finances before 
      realizing it must be done).
    </p>
    <p>
      These examples are closely related to &quot;gold standard&quot; part, in that 
      there is simplistic view of nations having to balance their check books 
      on very short term. This is neither practical nor beneficial. And trying 
      to force it to be done does not make it any more practical, beneficial 
      or wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet -- it seems that principled fools never let facts get in a way 
      of intuitive theories. So I am just waiting for a grand unified theory 
      that binds together ideas of tax-cut for riches, return to the gold 
      standard, and the idea that poor people caused depression (due to 
      welfare costs allegedly being a major contributor to this whole meltdown 
      -- don't ask me how the mechanism is supposed to play; apparently this 
      claim is getting some consideration in tea bagger circles).

      It is an unfortunate fact of life that &quot;news&quot; services in US are in 
      sorry, tepid state; and to get decent news coverage one has to use 
      better international sources (BBC, or any european agency), or turn to 
      non-daily/non-TV alternatives (magazines, which still offer reasonable 
      in-depth coverage). But this on-going idiotic episode with a celebrity 
      golf player's domestic issues takes the cake as the low point for this 
      decade (maybe competing with media's criticless bashing of UN Iraq 
      nuclear inspectors back in 2002 -- but I digress)<b>.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What could POSSIBLY be more important issue?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But hey, there have been recent orgies of lesser relevant news (did 
      Michael Jackson's or Ann-Nicole Smith's deaths really warrant being top 
      news entries). Why is this any different? Aside from being even less 
      relevant -- honestly, gossip pages, or perhaps sports section (... which 
      is ridiculously inflated part of local newspapers and TV programmes, 
      anyway...) would have been better placements; and for respectable 
      publications, possibly not even those -- than anything comparable in 
      recent history, there is the thing that there has actually been lots of 
      newsworthy things to write about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like, say, that gathering of world leaders in Copenhagen; discussing 
      urgent (and eventually life-and-death) matters of saving the world. And 
      in domestic section, well, there's plenty of economic stuff to write 
      about, or the thing about medical industry and insurance. Oh, and hey, 
      wasn't there a war of sizable portions also going on (actually, two, but 
      who's counting).
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, I can't think of a reason for this even ranking on page 7 of 
      thursday edition of the local newspaper. There are tabloids, after all, 
      that could cover this stuff. Well, except that in US, it's not 
      &quot;newspapers vs tabloids&quot;; it's mainstream (tabloid level) and fringes 
      (&quot;news of the world&quot;). Even mainstream sells manufactured controversies 
      (trademark of tabloid in other countries) and social porn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, somehow what irritates me most is that I noticed that CNN 
      followed up on this stupid episode like a hawk; as if it really was a 
      major story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. What did that &quot;N&quot; originally mean? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So why pick on CNN? After all, CNN is to News what MTV is to Music -- 
      sad, irrelevant misnomer. Ted Turner would be rolling in his grave was 
      he not alive. I guess it has more to do with the fact that CNN is 
      ostensibly in the news business. Newspapers and most other networks are 
      in general &quot;media&quot; business; they are also News dilettantes, spewing 
      some amateur-level newsy stuff. But clearly TV networks are more into 
      general entertainment; and newspapers into advertising with some 
      commentary columns (well, actually, they also do do some local news 
      stuff -- useful and sometimes noteworthy -- maybe I am being too harsh 
      --  but only local, seldom even reaching to regional level).
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's that when even entities that claim to do News fail to do that, 
      well, that's pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Message to mr. Woods</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok; enough ranting about sad state of US media. But here's a personal 
      message for the nominal cause of this red herring of a news: Tiger, go 
      stuff that golf club up your ass. Sideways. I don't care about your 
      business (personal or otherwise) -- but it appears that your messy 
      business has suddenly become my business. Stop it. Go, disappear. And 
      for crying out loud, don't cry out loud in public. It is so pathetically 
      unmanly that I feel nauseous. So, grow a spine (a pair you apparently 
      already have). Whatever else you do, do NOT cause more media events. You 
      are rich enough to afford to do whatever that other stupid athlete did 
      after murdering his wife (of hey, yeah, come to think of that, do not do 
      what that guy did in the end -- just the initial part of trying to keep 
      low profile).

      Ok, in between technical time, it's time to review some goofy stuff 
      while we wait for Santa. Here goes...
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Can't manage to find time to do something useful..</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      yet have plenty of time for &quot;time management&quot;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound silly? Have a look at <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro 
      Technique</a>. Great for giggles, as a case study for human insanity.<br>But 
      if it starts to make some sense at any point, do not hesitate to get 
      some professional help. Immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again, there are always some co-workers who might benefit 
      others by such techniques: by not having time to do anything, they could 
      not make mistakes. And that's worth something too (brakes for loose 
      cannons).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>update</b>: above comments are just related for application of said 
      technique(s) to software development -- maybe other domains could 
      benefit from intrusive regularly-scheduled interruptions (perhaps 
      augmented by electrical shocks)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. IRC? Yes, that thing hackers use when they don't want to be 
      overheard!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, you can always trust <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ">Numb3rs</a> 
      to get technical things FUBAR. Funny stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you will excuse me, I will have to disconnect from my blog 
      server before connection can be traced by FBI (it's that 30 second rule 
      you may know from movies -- must triangulate fast -- gotta go!)

      ignorant, incompetent boobs... or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually I avoid ranting, at least on my blog entries. Thing is, negative 
      output creates negative image: there is little positive in negativity. 
      If you have nothing good to say, say nothing, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes enough is enough. This is the case with Google, and their 
      pathetic attempts at Creating Java(-like) platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Past failures: Android</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past I have wondered at the clusterfuck known as Android: API is 
      a mess, concoction of JDK pieces included (and mixed with arbitrary open 
      source APIs and implementation classes) is arbitrary and incoherent. But 
      since I don't really work much in the mobile space, I have just shook my 
      head when observing it -- it's not really my problem. Just an eyesore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is relevant in that it set the precedent for what to expect: 
      despite some potentially clever ideas (regarding the lower level 
      machinery), it all seems like a trainwreck, heading nowhere fast. And 
      the only saving grace is that most mobile development platforms are even 
      worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Current problems: start with ignorance</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this marvellous learning experience, you might expect that the big 
      G would learn from its mistakes and get more things right second time 
      around. No such luck: <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google 
      App Engine</a> was a stillbirth; plagued by very similar problem as 
      Android. Most specifically, significant portion of what SHOULD be 
      available (given their implied goal of supporting all JDK5 pieces 
      applicable to the context) was -- and mostly still is -- missing. And 
      decisions again seem arbitrary and inconsistent; but probably made by 
      different bunch of junior developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My specific case in point (or pet peeve) is the lack of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1277">Stax 
      API on GAE</a> (it is missing from white-list, which is needed to load 
      anything within &quot;javax.&quot; packages). It seems clear that this was mostly 
      due to good old ignorance -- they just didn't have enough expertise 
      in-house to cover all necessary aspects of JDK. Hey, that happens: maybe 
      they have no XML expertise within the team; or whoever had some 
      knowledge was busy farting around doing something else. Who knows? 
      Should be easy to fix, whatever gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. From ignorance to excuses</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: omission due to ignorance would be easily solved. Just add 
      &quot;javax.xml.stream&quot; on the white list, and be done with that. After all, 
      what could possibly be problematic with an <i>API package</i>? (we are 
      not talking about bundling an implementation here)
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is where things get downright comical: almost all 
      &quot;explanations&quot; center around the strawman argument of &quot;there must be 
      some security-related issue here&quot;. I may be unfair here -- it is 
      possible that all people peddling this excuse are non-Googlians (if so, 
      my apologies to GAE team). But this is just very ridiculous (dare I say, 
      retarded?) argument, because:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Being but an API package, <b>there is no functionality</b> that could 
        possibly have security implications (yes, l know exactly what is 
        within those few classes -- the only actual code is for implementation 
        discover, which was copied from SAX), and
      </li>
      <li>
        If there are problems with implementations of the API (which should be 
        irrelevant, but humor me here), <b>same problems would affect already 
        included and sanctioned packages</b> (SAX, DOM, JAXP, bundled Xerces 
        implementation of the same)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Perhaps even worse, these &quot;explanations&quot; are served by people who seem 
      to have little idea about package in question. I could as well ask about 
      regular expression or image processing packages it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Misery loves company</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      About the only silver lining here (beyond my not having to work on 
      GAE...) is that there are other packages that got similarly hosed (I 
      think JAXB may be one of those; and many open source libraries are 
      affected indirectly, including popular packages like <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a>). 
      So hopefully there is little bit more pressure in fixing these flaws 
      within GAE.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I so hope that other big companies would consider implementing 
      sand-boxed &quot;cloudy&quot; Java environments. Too bad competitors like 
      Microsoft and <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> tend to focus on 
      other approaches: both doing &quot;their own things&quot;, although those being 
      very different from each other (Microsoft with their proprietary 
      technology; Amazon focusing on offering low-level platform (EC2) and 
      simple services (S3, SQS, SWF -- simple storage, queue, workflow service 
      -- etc), but not managed runtime execution service.
