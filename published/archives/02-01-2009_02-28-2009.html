      Here's a project (from a comment to the earlier annotation-related 
      entry) that looks pretty interesting: <a href="http://scannotation.sourceforge.net/">Scannotation</a>. 
      Ability to automagically find out things that are annotated, with zero 
      configuration (plug and play), sounds pretty cool to me.

			<h3 class="entry-header">On musical influences: Roy Wood, one of the Greats (and Supertramp too)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Another important question (besides the &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/02/entry_56.html">what's 
      in it for you</a>&quot; one, regarding Open Source) is the &quot;<b>what 
      are your biggest musical influences</b>&quot; one. I guess it is somewhat 
      more common to ask this question from actual musicians, so I have not 
      had a chance to answer this question in detail so far.<br>But never 
      fear: I now choose to partially and pre-emptively answer this question, 
      here and now.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Since the full list of notable influences would get rather long, so we 
      can start by filtering out most of irrelevant ear sore.<br>Sample query 
      like this will get us started:
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      SELECT * FROM all_available WHERE time_period BETWEEN late-60s and 
      mid-70s AND genre in (pop, rock)
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      That is pretty broad and will still give us lots of irrelevant crap (and 
      perhaps filter couple of big ones, like GnR and AC/DC -- notable if not 
      fatal loss). But it does reduce the range a bit, and within this scope, 
      here are 2 recent delightful discoveries (and purchases) of mine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
        <a href="http://www.roywood.co.uk/">Roy Wood</a>'s (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Wood">here</a> 
        too) first (and best?) solo album: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCXF6U">Boulder</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068FXR">Crisis? What 
        crisis?</a> by Supertramp
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Both Roy &amp; Supertramp have been my favorites for quite a while: Roy 
      originally due to being the genius behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Move">The 
      Move</a> (and also big part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO">ELO</a>'s 
      first one; Jeff's one of the Greats too). And Supertramp is such a 
      show-off group of technical perfectionists that &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-America-Supertramp/dp/B000068FWC">Breakfast 
      in America</a>&quot; (their most widely-known and sold album) CD is pretty 
      much worn off by now too.

    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      Regarding Boulder: it is sad that its release was delayed by so much 
      that its sales were much weaker: had it been released in -69, it might 
      have been in top-10, at least in UK. But by -73, soundscape had change 
      quite a bit and I suspect sales were tepid. But the record itself is a 
      delightful and goofy venture: totally enjoyable even now. And it is 
      strange how a song like &quot;Miss Clarke and the Computer&quot; sounds less dated 
      than most similar takes from early 80s (including ELO's &quot;Time&quot; -- great 
      record, rather contrived lyrics tho, but I guess that is trademark ELO 
      too -- but I digress). I don't know if Boulder is actually my all-time 
      favorite by Roy: that might actually be from The Move, their first or 
      last album. Singles like &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Wild Tiger Woman&quot;, &quot;Fire Brigade&quot;, 
      &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;No Time&quot; are off the hook, and list just goes on and 
      on. But Boulder is a very good album at any rate, even if not a hit 
      collection.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-weight=normal,font-size=3,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-family=Tahoma,}" margin-top="0">
      And then &quot;the Crisis&quot; (hey, maybe they were referring to Mike Oldfield's 
      Crises? Nah, that wasn't quite yet released -- yet another very good 
      record there, released a few years afer this one). Well: it only took 2 
      listenings to find out that I really like the record. As of yet, I still 
      slightly prefer &quot;the Breakfast&quot;. But that might change. First 5 songs 
      are very close to perfect, in their own class of very polished rock, 
      including surprisingly good lyrics. They really might be the only 
      contemporary group to be considered similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_dan">Steely 
      Dan</a> (not surprisingly, I like Dans too -- albeit only having their 
      2-CD collection).
    </p>

      Anyhoo: thought I'd share this. More to come, over time. Groove on!

			<h3 class="entry-header">Frustrations with Java Annotations</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      <b>(note: minor update on 28-Feb-2009, regarding generics)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately I have been working intensively with code that deals with Java 
      annotations. That is, not just annotating classes for use by other 
      packages, but writing code that reads such annotations. This is within 
      context of <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson JSON-processor</a>; 
      latest versions can use annotations to configure details of how Object 
      serialization and deserialization (data binding) work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learnt to appreciate many things with annotations. They work kind 
      of nicely, and the ability to use meta-annotations makes it possible to 
      even build reusable generic annotation processors (although I am not 
      aware of much work in this area -- but I haven't been looking actively). 
      Also, although limitation to literal types (primitives, Strings, Enums, 
      Class literals, arrays of the same) limits things a bit, it is an 
      understandable restriction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have also found couple of major frustrations with annotations. So 
      here's the airing of grievances (yeah, I know, it's not yet even 
      festivus...):
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Inability to extend annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating sets of annotations for a library, it would be useful to 
      be able to create &quot;base annotations&quot;. Why? For example to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        check if a given Annotation type extends the base annotation, to 
        easily recognize &quot;my annotations&quot; (if (annotation instanceof 
        MyBaseAnnotation.class) ...&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        define common set of base properties for related annotations, 
        including default values for some
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that lack of sub-classing is also frustrating with 
      Enums, which have some similarities to annotation type.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect there may be solid reasons for not allowing sub-classing. But 
      it is unfortunate at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Inability to use null as value</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps more importantly, there is no way to indicate &quot;none&quot; for any 
      value arguments (String, enums or Class value) -- you can't do something 
      like:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <pre>  @UseClass(null) // illegal, won't compile</pre>
    <p>
      (and ditto for default values). So to denote such a missing or 
      non-applicable value, you need to provide a dummy value like 
      &quot;NoClass.class&quot;. Yuck. And with Strings you are just out of luck. This 
      is unfortunate, and I don't know why such a limitation is necessary. It 
      would seem logical to allow nulls for values, including default values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Lack of Generics (with Class arguments)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not really something annotations fuctionality itself can do much 
      about: but I will list it nonetheless. It is a shame that one can not 
      add typing to Classes. I mean, it's quite different to specify:
    </p>
    <p>
      HashMap.class
    </p>
    <p>
      than would something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      HashMap&lt;String,Integer&gt;.class
    </p>
    <p>
      (if that was legal, which it isn't). This of course ties back to the &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/12/entry_126.html">Why 
      Java Generics Suck</a>&quot; entry from a while ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Links Galore: Bayesian classification, Nifty new language features for Java</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Here are some miscellaneous interesting links for Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Core Java</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not paid close attention to the development of Java core language 
      or JDK since, well, probably 1.1. It's nothing ideological, nothing 
      against sneak peeks, but in general I can wait until things get fully 
      baked. Most music I listen is still from late 60s and early 70s; I have 
      scarcely seen a movie released less than 2 years ago (I'll just Netflix 
      highly-rated interesting looking ones over time). You get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I couldn't help but nice links to 2 interesting things happening 
      right now:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/darcy/entry/project_coin">Project coin</a> 
        seems like a set of nifty improvements to the core language. I like 
        the idea of small-but-nice usability improvements -- they tend to be 
        overlooked in favor of bigger, bolder and riskier undertakings 
        (besides, these kinds of things often complement each other, why 
        choose?)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/opinali/archive/2009/02/here_comes_jdk.html">Latest 
        JDK 1.6 update</a> seem to pack surprisingly sophisticated things: I 
        am positively surprised by inclusion of the mythical &quot;Garbage First&quot; 
        collector making it into a stable JDK
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>2. Simple IR libs</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that seems immediately useful is a general purpose library for 
      doing basic Bayesian classifications: and <a href="https://ci-bayes.dev.java.net/">CI-Bayes</a> 
      (java version of python stuff from &quot;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/">Programming 
      Collective Intelligence</a>&quot; book if I understood it right) seems to be 
      just the thing. About the only concern I have is their use of Javolution 
      (seems to be used for &quot;fast&quot; hash maps -- I have my doubts), but that's 
      just my personal pet peeve.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Update I on Update of Json-parsing performance</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      After writing <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/02/entry_204.html">the 
      entry</a> about parsing performance measurements, I got feedback leading 
      to bit more comple test. Specifically, one of packages (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/">json.simple</a>) 
      actually does offer streaming API as well. So I ended up adding one more 
      test case. Turns out that the package in question gets some measurable 
      boost from this (throughput +15-25%), see the <a href="/perf/json-count-2009-02-20-2cpus/index.html">full 
      updated results</a>. And here's the &quot;quick pic&quot; as well&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <img border="2" src="/perf/json-count-2009-02-20-2cpus/testcase0.jpg" alt="Performance Graph" height="550" align="left" width="750">
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, one thing the original entry did not cover was how to interpret 
      the results. Here's a brief summary:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        'results' marked with 'KB' just indicate size of the parsed document 
        (same for all parsers)
      </li>
      <li>
        actual results are in 'tps' (transactions per second), and &quot;bigger is 
        better&quot;: transaction here is a single parse through the doc and 
        accumulation of field counts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (and for more, you may want to check out how <a href="http://japex.dev.java.net">Japex</a> 
      works in general).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope this helps.
    </p></p>

      us being involved. No wonder grandparents and their grandchildren often 
      get along pretty nicely.

      But sometimes star align in surprisingly pleasant ways, and there are 
      these inter-generational bright spots in life. One such thing is the 
      by-now passe (I assume -- I always learn these things very late, so I 
      can assume it has passed by a while ago; apparently almost exactly 1 
      year ago now) &quot;Mom Song&quot;. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESe-AysF9mw">decent 
      version</a> (as in sung by a professional, using original lyrics) link 
      to which I was sent by my mom. Hilarious, and painfully true. As an 
      added bonus, I did learn a few useful phrases to use with my kids too 
      (or in some cases idiomatic translations of phrases I was familiar with, 
      but not in english -- my favorite must be &quot;were you born in a barn, 
      would you like some hay&quot;).

      Anyhow, that link made my day, as well as that of my children. They like 
      it too. But probably at bit different level. They will get the deeply 
      painful (and yet more satisfactory) meaning in a few if and when they 
      multiply.

      This just struck me: <b>Telling the truth is a very underappreciated 
      craft</b>. And a singularly useful one too. Feel free to quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      That should be obvious but apparently isn't. When honed to perfection, 
      and applied with straight face, it can also be used with surgical 
      precision, effectively and elegantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why people waste more time on telling half-assed lies is beyond me -- 
      liars need good memory, and excellent mental project management 
      capabilities (which are in short order for most people anyway); and yet 
      lying generally produces no better results than telling the truth, even 
      when one does not get caught. And very few people get addicted to 
      telling the truth, to the degree they couldn't stop doing it. Quite the 
      reverse is true for lying and dishonesty.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Update on State of Json-parsing Performance</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (<b>22-Feb-2009, NOTE</b>: there is <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/02/entry_213.html">an 
      update</a> to this update with even more up-to-date results!)
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been good year and a half since I blogged about Json performance 
      (&quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2007/09/entry_48.html">More 
      on JSON performance in Java (or lack thereof)</a>&quot; ).<br>So it is 
      about time to revisit the question and see what is the state of the art 
      with Java Json processing today.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time I will be using a bit more full-featured performance benchmark 
      framework: (codename &quot;StaxBind&quot;), which is based on <a href="http://japex.dev.java.net">Japex</a>, 
      and allows for easy comparison of different data format / library 
      combination for different tasks. Initially aimed at comparing data 
      binding performance for xml processing (hence the name), it is growing 
      for a more general purpose data format processing performance testing 
      framework.<br>For now the module is available from <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a> 
      repository, and contains a few test cases including one used here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since benchmarks are run using <a href="http://japex.dev.java.net/">Japex</a> 
      the results should be more informative as well as reproduceable; plus, 
      we get some pretty graphs to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Test case: &quot;json-field-count&quot;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific test used from StaxBind is &quot;json-count&quot;, test designed to 
      allow testing a wide selection of available Java Json parsers. Test code 
      essentially traverses through given Json documents, counting instances 
      of field names; results are verified before each test to ensure that all 
      parsers (or rather, test drivers for parsers) see the same data.<br>This 
      traversal operation is not an overly meaningful in itself, but it is 
      easy to implement for most parsers (see below for exceptions), and 
      should be reasonably fair and representative regarding expected 
      processing performance. The other more obvious choice would be a data 
      binding test -- I hope to cover that later on -- but that will mean 
      writing much more test code for packages that do not support automatic 
      data binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Sample documents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For testing I chose 3 different Json documents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sample #4 from json.org <a href="http://json.org / http://www.json.org/example.html">example 
        docs section</a> (the one with &quot;web-app&quot; struct)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sample <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Search+API+Documentation">Twitter 
        search response</a> message
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;db100.xml&quot; (from XMLTest document set) automatically converted to json
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Document sizes vary from 3 to 15 kB; fairly small, but enough to show 
      the trend about parsing performance. This is not a great set of 
      documents to use, but since there is generally accepted set of Json test 
      documents available (or if there is, please let me know!), it will have 
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Parsers compared</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to choose parsers to test from <a href="http://json.org">json.org</a>'s 
      java parser implementation list. I think that is the most likely 
      starting point for developers; and it is reasonably complete list as 
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all listed libraries from the list qualify. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some libraries included use another Json parser: for example, both <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a> 
        and <a href="http://jettison.codehaus.org">Jettison</a> use the 
        &quot;json.org&quot; reference implementation as the underlying parser
      </li>
      <li>
        Some libraries can only generate Json, not parse it (such as flex-json
      </li>
      <li>
        One otherwise decent-looking candidate (Google-gson) only implements 
        data-bin ding interface, which is which might may be a decent Json 
        processing package only seems to implement data binding functionality, 
        but not streaming or tree-based alternative (I am hoping to include it 
        in the data-binding tests)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given this, here are the contestants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://json.org">Json.org</a> reference implementation: the 
        &quot;standard&quot; choice most developers start with
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://jsontools.berlios.de/">Json Tools</a> from Berlios 
        (full-featured, well-documented)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/">Json-lib</a> (another 
        fairly full-featured package)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/">Json-simple</a> from 
        Google code
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://stringtree.org/stringtree-json.html">StringTree JSON</a> 
        (delightfully compact code; alas very simplistic regarding 
        well-formedness checks)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson</a> (the reigning 
        champion from the last test), version <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/Download">0.9.8</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of these, all implement a tree-model; some also implement data binding 
      (json-tools and Jackson at least), but only Jackson appears to implement 
      pure streaming interface. For this reason, there are 2 tests for 
      Jackson: one using Tree model, the other streaming API.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Results</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After letting Japex churn through the test for almost an hour, we get 
      the actual results. Full result data and graphs can be found <a href="/perf/json-count-2009-02-17/index.html">here</a>. 
      (also: here are result from <a href="/perf/json-count-2009-02-17-2cpus/index.html">another 
      test run</a> (this one with a more modern dual-core system). Both runs 
      are on a Linux desktop machine, using a recent JVM (1.6.0 update 10 or 
      12)
    </p>
    <p>
      But here is the main graph (from the first test run) that summarizes 
      results:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img border="2" src="/perf/json-count-2009-02-17/testcase0.jpg" alt="Performance Graph" height="550" align="left" width="750">
      
    </p>
    <p>
      It looks like Jackson is still rather more efficient at parsing than the 
      rest: not only is the core streaming parser very fast, even the 
      tree-based alternative does quite well. In fact, graph readability 
      suffers a little bit from Jackson's dominance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the rest, StringTree parser performs a bit better than the 
      others. But the biggest surprise may be the fact the reference 
      implementation is faster than most alternatives; despite the claims made 
      for these alternatives (I have yet to find a library that doesn't claim 
      to be light-weight and fast :) ). In a way that's good -- at least most 
      developers are not using the slowest available parsers.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Vaccine against Stupidity, anyone?</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One of more depressing trends of lately has been the constant flood of 
      fabricated &quot;controversies&quot;: cases where ignorant and misguided yet 
      fiercely determined people have been able to get media to represent 
      &quot;both sides of the issue&quot;, and causing countless shit storms of 
      misinformation, which just further spreads stupidity. Kind of how virus 
      infections like common cold spread, come to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      List of such topics is long, including things like &quot;evolution 
      controversy&quot;, &quot;greenhouse effect ain't&quot;, &quot;scientology is victim of 
      anti-religious governments&quot;, &quot;solar-power is blocked by powerful oil 
      producers&quot; and so forth. These things seem to be escepially prone to 
      occur whenever there is even a hint of the Big Conspiracy; usually by a 
      large loosely defined international entity of some sort; anything from 
      the United Nations to Big Pharmaceuticals and Cabal of Climatologist 
      seem to qualifiy. But perhaps the most worrisome is the still on-going 
      perverse tale of &quot;vaccinaction deniers&quot;. You know, those misguided and 
      harmful parents (and occasionally, celebrities) that claim that 
      vaccinations should be stopped, based on scant evidence and strong 
      conviction. The most common allegation against vaccination is the 
      missing link known as &quot;vaccinations cause autism&quot;; allegation completely 
      unsupported by actual facts and research. And obviously this all is 
      caused
    </p>
    <p>
      There are plenty of good (and scary) articles on the subject, but the 
      latest one to catch my attention was from &quot;<a href="http://www.thatsfuckingstupid.com/index.php/2008/11/just-a-quickie-you-wont-feel-a-thing/">That's 
      Fucking Stupid</a>&quot; web site (love the name btw). So not only are some 
      american celebrities infected with contagious stupidity, but so are some 
      of them english folks too. And the article also refers bunch of stuff 
      from <a href="http://www.thatsfuckingstupid.com/index.php/2008/11/just-a-quickie-you-wont-feel-a-thing/">Bad 
      Science</a>, another worthy web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the immediate concern is the health of children of these sorry 
      individuals, an even more relevant question is the fate of the people 
      who do take vaccinations (and their kin). That is, the rest of us. 
      Ultimately we may pay the biggest price, due to loss of &quot;the Herd 
      Immunity&quot;. To simplify, when big enough slice of population has 
      immunity, those without immunity will still get decent protection; and 
      conversely, if there is not enough overall protection, ones without 
      protection are even more prone to get the disease. It boils down to 
      basic statistics and epidomological spread of diseaser, but has been 
      well-established over time: with high enough vaccination coverage 
      (coupled with effective treatments for those who do catch the disease), 
      even not-so-effective vaccines work well. So: thanks to Jenny M and 
      other numbskulls, my family becomes bit less protected against 
      potentially lethal diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all makes me wonder we will ever get Cure for the malaise known as 
      Common Stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that happens, best we can do is to learn from books like &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psychology/dp/030012385X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234585367&sr=1-1">What 
      Intelligence Test Miss: the Psychology of Rational Thought</a>&quot; (another 
      book I found via <a href="http://www.sciam.com/sciammind/">SciAm Mind</a>). 
      Here's hoping for the second coming of the Age of Reason.

      This took way longer than it should have, but after a wait spanning

      Once again, one of my favorite magazines, Scientific America (and the 
      specific &quot;flavor&quot;, SA Mind) had a very interesting article: &quot;<a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-serious-need-for-play">the 
      Serious Need for Play</a>&quot;. It is fascinating to know that not only is 
      playing good for you, but that it is essential and necessary for normal 
      social (and perhaps intellectual) development. And especially the &quot;free 
      play&quot; variety, where children make their own rules: too many parents are 
      Gung Ho about &quot;developmentally beneficial&quot; games, activities -- 
      sometimes not much more than organized preparation for school -- that 
      their children barely really play at all. It's not all that playful if 
      you just follow rules set up by somebody else.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-weight=normal,font-style=,font-family=Tahoma,font-size=3,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      The link to serial killers is mentioned, too; that most of the worst 
      serial killers shared just 2 things: abuse during childhood, and lack of 
      playing as children. And while it is hard to know what is the nature of 
      correlation (is it just psychologically skewed individual don't play?), 
      it is a chilling to think of all the consequences of parental actions, 
      too strict disciplinary actions and abuse by absence and/or inattention.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-weight=normal,font-style=,font-family=Tahoma,font-size=3,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      There are many other interesting tidbits sprinkled in there: I didn't 
      know, for example, that children use more complicated language when 
      communicating with their peers, than with adults. When you think about 
      it, it does make sense -- adults &quot;help&quot; by understanding this more 
      easily, basically not demanding children to stretch their verbal 
      capabilities -- but it's still not entirely intuitive.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-weight=normal,font-style=,font-family=Tahoma,font-size=3,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      Plus one more rather surprising finding: that &quot;rough housing&quot; (mock 
      fights, rough playing, more common with boys) actually helps with 
      development (or, correlates with it at any rate) of social skills. That 
      seems very surprising, given the stereotypical image of naughty boys, 
      and well-intentioned but misguided efforts by caretakers to reign in all 
      such play.
    </p>

      Anyway: one more interesting article. I just need more time to read all 
      these articles. :-)

			<h3 class="entry-header">Typed Access API tutorial, part II: arrays</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      It has been a while, but it's now time to continue the overview of Typed 
      Access API, one of major features of Stax2 API version 3, implemented by 
      Woodstox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/12/entry_118.html">first 
      part</a> of this mini-series dealt with &quot;simple&quot; values like integers 
      and booleans. So let's look at structured types that Typed Access API 
      supports. Selection is quite limited: only 4 fundamental types (int, 
      long, float, double) are directly supported, but perhaps most 
      interestingly there is also a way to easily extend this functionality to 
      parse custom types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrived example to consider this time is that of a data set that 
      consists of large number of rows, each with large number of integers. 
      This could come from a spreadsheet full of sample data or such. 
      Traditionally you might think of storing it using format like:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;dataset&gt;
 &lt;datarow&gt;
  &lt;data&gt;1&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;data&gt;5&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;!-- and so on --&gt;
 &lt;/datarow&gt;
&lt;/dataset&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      But with Typed Access for arrays, you realize that you can actually make 
      it like this instead:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;dataset&gt;
 &lt;datarow&gt;1 5 &lt;!-- and so on --&gt; &lt;/datarow&gt;
&lt;/dataset&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      Which looks a bit better, and saves a byte or two in storage space as 
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Reading numeric arrays</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So how would we read such data? And, regarding this example, what should 
      we do with the data? Due to my limited skills in statistics, let's just 
      calculate 3 simple(st) aggregates available: minimum value, maximum 
      value, and total sum.
    </p>
    <pre>InputStream in = new FileInputStream(&quot;data.xml&quot;);
TypedXMLStreamReader sr = (TypedXMLStreamReader) XMLInputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamReader(in);
int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;<br>int total = 0;<br>sr.nextTag(); // dataset<br>int[] buffer = new int[20];<br>// let's loop over all &lt;datarow&gt; elements:
while (sr.nextTag() == XMLStreamConstants.START_ELEMENT) { // ends when we hit &lt;/dataset&gt;
// loop to get all int values for the row<br>  int count;<br>  while ((count = sr.readElementAsIntArray(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) &gt; 0) {<br>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i) {<br>      int sample = buffer[i];<br>      total += sample;<br>      min = Math.min(min, sample);<br>      max = Math.max(max, sample);<br>    }
// once there are no more samples, we'll be pointing to matching END_ELEMENT, as per javadocs<br>  }<br>}
sr.close();
in.close();
// and there we have it<br></pre>
    <p>
      So far so good: we just need a buffer to read into, and we can read 
      numeric element content in. With attributes code is even simpler, since 
      the whole array would be returned with a single call (this because 
      attribute values are inherently non-streamable).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Writing numeric arrays</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So where would we get this data? Ah, let me come up with something... 
      hmmh, why, yes, how about someone gave us a spreadsheet as a CSV 
      (comma-separated value) file? That'll work. So, given this file, we 
      could convert that into xml and... well, have some sample code to show. 
      Sweet!
    </p>
    <pre>  BufferedReader r = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(&quot;data.csv&quot;), &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
  OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(&quot;data.xml&quot;);
  String line;

  TypedXMLStreamWriter sw = (TypedXMLStreamWriter) XMLOutputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamWriter(out, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
  sw.writeStartDocument();
  sw.writeStartElement(&quot;dataset&quot;);

  while ((line = r.readLine()) != null) {
    sw.writeStartElement(&quot;datarow&quot;);
    String[] tokens = line.split(&quot;,&quot;); // assume comma as separator
    int[] values = new int[tokens.length];
    for (int i = 0; i  values.length; ++i) {
      values[i] = Integer.parseInt(values[i]);
    }
    sw.writeIntArray(values, 0, values.length);
    sw.writeEndElement();
  }
  sw.writeEndElement();
  sw.writeEndDocument();</pre>
    <p>
      And there we have that, too. Simple? About the only additional thing 
      worth noting is that we could have done outputting of int arrays in 
      multiple steps too, if the incoming rows were very large. It is 
      perfectly fine to call <b>sw.writeIntArray()</b> multiple times 
      consecutively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Reading arrays of custom types</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let's consider the feature that might be the most interesting 
      aspect of Typed Access API array handling: ability to plug in custom 
      decoders. Just as with simple values (with which you can use<i><b> 
      TypedXMLStreamReader.getElementAs(TypedValueDecoder)</b></i>), there is 
      a specific method (<i><b>TypedXMLStreamReader.readElementArrayAs(TypedArrayDecoder)</b></i>) 
      that acts as the extension point.
    </p>
    <p>
      One possibility is to use one of existing simple value decoders (from 
      package <i>org.codehaus.stax2.ri.typed</i>; inner classes of<i> 
      ValueDecoderFactory</i>); this would allow implementing accessor for, 
      say, QName[] or boolean[]. But for simplicity, let's write our own 
      EnumSet decoder: decoder that can decode set of enumerated values into a 
      container; for example, colors using their canonical names. We'll do it 
      like so:
    </p>
    <pre>class ColorDecoder
  extends TypedArrayDecoder
{
  public enum Color { FOO, BAR, OTHER };
  
  EnumSet&lt;Color&gt; colors;
  
  public boolean decodeValue(char[] buffer, int start, int end) {
    return decodeValue(new String(buffer, start, end-start));
  } 
  public boolean decodeValue(String input) {
    // would also be very easy to call a standard TypedValueDecoder here
    colors.add(Color.valueOf(input));
  }
  public int getCount() { return colors.size(); }
  public boolean hasRoom() { return true; } // never full

  // Note: needed, but not part of TypedArrayDecoder
  EnumSet&lt;Color&gt; getColors() { return colors; }
}</pre>
    <p>
      And to use it, we would just do something like:
    </p>
    <pre>  TypedXMLStreamReader sr = ...;
  ColorDecoder dec = new ColorDecoder();
  sr.readElementAsArray(dec);
  EnumSet&lt;Color&gt; colors = dec.getColors();</pre>
    <p>
      And obviously one can easily create sets of commonly needed decoders to 
      essentially create semi-automated xml data binding libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Benefits of Array Access using Typed Access API</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know what can be done and how, it is worth considering one 
      important question: why? What are the benefits of using Typed Access 
      API, over alternatives like get-element-value-parse-yourself?<br>Consider 
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allows use of more compact representation: space-separated values, 
        instead of wrapping each individual value in an element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Faster, not only due to compactness (which in itself helps a lot), but 
        also due to more optimal access Woodstox gives to raw data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower memory usage for large data sets: since array access is chunked, 
        memory usage is only relative to size of chunks. You can handle 
        gigabyte sized data files with modest memory usage -- something no 
        other standard API (or, for that matter, any non-standard API I am 
        aware of) on Java platform allows!
      </li>
      <li>
        More readable xml: compact representation generally improves 
        readability.
      </li>
      <li>
        With pluggable decoders can build simple reusable datatype libraries, 
        while still adding very little processing overhead
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And these are just benefits compared to other Stax-based approaches. 
      Benefits over, say, accessing data via DOM trees (*) are significantly 
      higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      (*) although note that you can actually use Stax2 Typed Access API on 
      DOM trees, by constructing TypedXMLStreamReader from DOMSource, using 
      Woodstox 4!
    </p></p>

      One more interesting project that mr. Kawaguchi kindly pointed us to is <a href="https://akuma.dev.java.net/">Akuma</a>. 
      It seems like a useful tube of gorilla glue, to gel Java code bit more 
      closely (and correctly) with native crap that one may have to run. It 
      also appears useful for all kinds of launchers, nanny scripts, &quot;process 
      managers&quot;, and other wrappers; allowing one to write these in Java, or 
      even avoid having to write wrappers at all.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Json processing with Jackson: Which method to use?</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Now that we have reviewed all the methods (specifically, <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_132.html">Stream-of-Events</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_137.html">Data 
      Binding</a> and <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_153.html">Tree 
      Model</a>), the remaining question is: which one is right for me?<br>There 
      are no hard and fast rules, but here are couple of perspectives that may 
      be useful in sorting it all out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. If all else fails, bind to objects</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      My personal favorite is the data binding, and barring specific reasons 
      to contrary, data binding seems like a good default choice. If it 
      doesn't work, other alternatives will still be available; but usually it 
      &quot;Just Works&quot;. And I like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. For extreme efficiency, use Stream-of-Events</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For developers with extremely frugal resource constraints (memory, cpu), 
      nothing beats the &quot;raw&quot; streaming API. It uses minimum amount of memory, 
      does not construct any more objects than are absolutely needed, and does 
      this very fast. There's no scroogier way to deal with Json. It is not 
      the most convenient way, but it is efficient and flexible. You just have 
      to be a DIY handy man; and the interface is WYWIWYG (What You Write Is 
      What You Get). No syntactic sugar, just a bit more monkey code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. For write-only use cases, Stream-of-Events does just fine</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given how simple it is generate (write) Json content, there are often no 
      particular reasons to use anything more complicated than a 
      JsonGenerator. That is, when input does not come from a Json source (if 
      it did, other alternatives might be more tempting).
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, considering that if you don't start with any Json-based 
      construct, streaming API may be even simpler than Tree Model based one 
      or data binding: after all, to use the Tree Model you must build a tree; 
      and for data binding have to construct objects to convert to Json. That 
      is just overhead if the only purpose is to generate Json.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. For flexible traversal, try the Tree Model</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have to do lots of traversal, especailly using dynamic rules, and 
      possibly incomplete and/or non-regular content, Tree Model is often 
      often the best choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Tree Model works well for prototyping</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a special case for dynamic traversal and access, prototyping 
      (including cases where Json interchange data format changes rapidly) is 
      one case where Tree Model can be useful. The problem with Data Binding 
      is the very tight coupling between Java classes and resulting Json. It 
      is often less work to change the code that traverses Tree Model than to 
      change the object model AND code that uses objects. And there is 
      generally less code to traverse a tree than do deal with event streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Other suggestions?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have dumped my initial thoughts, I realize how scattered they 
      are. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm sure I am missing obvious things, or may be grouping unrelated 
      things together. Please let me know what I got wrong!

			<h3 class="entry-header">How to vet Killer Ideas</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Blog entry &quot;<a href="http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/01/27/the-5-steps-to-a-great-startup-idea/">5 
      steps to a Great Startup Idea</a>&quot; caught my attention. The particularly 
      insightful part for me was the third step (&quot;The Crash&quot;). It aligns with 
      my thoughts on the matter: as the adage goes, &quot;Great minds think alike&quot;. 
      Many (most?) famous inventions ended up in a tight race for the first 
      claim for a good (enough) implementation. And for what it's worth, most 
      ideas I had that I consider(ed) particularly good were implemented by 
      others sooner or later (things like triangulating web accessibility 
      statistics from multiple points, and spreadsheet-in-javascript (~= 
      google apps)); ideas that I contemplated focusing more on after building 
      a prototype that worked well enough, but that I never had enough faith 
      in to go commercial with.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing worth noticing of course is that this relationship is not 
      symmetric: while good ideas are generally spotted by multiple entities, 
      the reverse is not true: just because certain ideas are worked on by 
      many doesn't mean they are good. Good judgment doesn't really grow up in 
      trees, nor do all should-supported containers contain any. Even fools 
      work on things that they consider interesting. That doesn't change the 
      fact that they are fools, and who by definition won't be able to 
      differentiate between good, bad and &quot;whatever&quot; ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess one way to look at this is that if an idea is any good, there is 
      or will soon be company in doing it. And if no one is (observed yet) 
      doing it, you should at least be able to get &quot;Ah, but of course!&quot; 
      reaction to it, when presented to skilled practicioners of your art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally: I guess I will also have to side with Paul Graham and disagree 
      with authors of the article itself: I do think ideas, even good ones, 
      are more of a dime-a-dozen variety than otherwise. It may be that the 
      distribution of idea follows some exponential curve (and it certainly is 
      neither flat nor gaussian). But it has always seemed that the difference 
      between success and lack thereof is that of choosing the ideas (and 
      believing and ones chosen), not that of generating them.
    </p></p>
