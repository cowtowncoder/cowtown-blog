			<h3 class="entry-header">Nux version 1.6 released</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">

  Another release, and this one very important, is that of <a href="http://dsd.lbl.gov/nux/">Nux</a> 
  XML processing toolkit: version 1.6 was just released. For those not 
  familiar with Nux, it is a collection of useful helper functionality and 
  extensions that make XML processing (and some related content management 
  things like search indexing) more convenient, powerful or easier, or 
  oftentimes, &quot;all of above&quot;. Some notable features are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Extended XQuery/XPath support (with <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
XOM extensions, including efficient builders and serializers
  </li>
  <li>
VERY fast Binary XML implementation, BNux (about 2x as fast as Sun's 
<a href="https://fi.dev.java.net/">Fast Infoset</a> -- and thereby almost 3x as fast as <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a>); possibly the fastest way to transform XML Infoset content 
in Java.
  </li>
  <li>
Full-text search extensions based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>; 
especially for cases where individual documents can be stored fully in 
memory, but need to be searched using powerful search queries.
  </li>
  <li>
Extensive performance test suite that allows for comparing various XML 
processor (parsing, serialization) implementations; from binary 
variants to traditional text-based ones (DOM, SAX, StAX).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Personally I am very impressed by the binary infoset implementation, as 
  well as the overall quality of the package. It is one of those packages 
  I wish more developers were aware of.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Stax Reference Implementation version 1.2 release</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      This may not be a big news, but since many newcomers to Stax-based XML 
      processing start with <a href="http://stax.codehaus.org">the reference 
      implementation</a>, the release of the 1.2 version final is still 
      important. There has been lots of fixes to the most immediate and severe 
      problems, and now the reference implementation finally passes most of 
      StaxTest unit tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still some things missing from the RI (such as coalescing 
      mode, NamespaceContext for Event objects), but at least now it should be 
      possible to try out simple example documents without hitting obvious 
      problems with character entities and such. Also, handling of namespace 
      URIs is more consistent now: null will now always be returned for 
      prefixes that are not bound (and for the default namespace if no 
      explicit binding is present).
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">New features of upcoming release 3.0 of Woodstox</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Although the final 3.0 release of <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a> 
      has not yet been done, the API and feature set are now frozen, after the 
      release of the first release candidate. Because of this, now is the 
      perfect time to have a look at what the 3.0 release will bring, compared 
      to the trusty old 2.0.x version.
    </p>
    <p>
      At high-level, main changes are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rewritten validation sub-system, along with a new validator 
        implementation for <a href="http://www.relaxng.org/">Relax NG</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Significant performance improvements to both stream reader and writer; 
        especially when processing small documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Further improvements to XML conformance, now XML 1.0 and 1.1 
        conformance is over 99% as measured by the industry standard <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/1999/09/conformance/testing.html">XMLTest</a> 
        conformance suite (tested using <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/SAXTest/">SAXTest</a> 
        and SAX wrappers from <a href="https://stax-utils.dev.java.net/">stax-utils</a>). 
        Specifically conformance of DTD-handling is significantly improved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Significantly improved test coverage, both regarding features tested 
        and actual code coverage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved interoperability; behavior unified with the <a href="http://stax.codehaus.org">Stax 
        reference implementation</a> (including changes to one or both, as 
        dictated by accepted Stax specification interpretations); addition of 
        DOMSource that allows creating of XMLStreamReader from DOM tree; and 
        addition of UTF-32 encoding support.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional operating modes: parsing mode (tree [default], forest, 
        fragment); ability to handle undeclared entities gracefully (in 
        non-entity-expanding mode).
      </li>
      <li>
        Convergence of writer and reader side functionality, by adding 
        features to writers that were missing (optional line number reporting, 
        xml warning handler, disabling of namespace handling), done in the 
        context of Stax2 extended API.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For even more complete picture of many of the individual changes, you 
      can check out the <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/WSTX">Jira</a> 
      bug-tracking system used by Woodstox project; there are almost 40 
      resolved entries for 3.0 release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the changes mentioned above, the first one may be the most 
      significant new feature. It also resulted in the complete rewrite of 
      existing (DTD) validation system. The re-designed system is now:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fully pluggable: 
        org.codehaus.stax2.validation.XMLValidationSchemaFactory 
        implementations can be included similar to the way basic Stax 
        implementations of XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory can be 
        included and discovered dynamically. This can theoretically allow 
        implementation of cross-implementation validators in future. 3.0 
        release includes the rewritten native DTD validator, as well as a 
        Relax NG validator based on Sun's <a href="https://msv.dev.java.net/">Multi-Schema 
        Validator</a>. There are also plans to include MSV-based W3C Schema 
        Validator in near future
      </li>
      <li>
        Bi-directional: same validators can be used both when parsing (with 
        XMLStreamReader) and when serializing (with XMLStreamWriter).
      </li>
      <li>
        Validators are chainable, so that a single XML event stream can be 
        validated against multiple validation schemas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Customizable error handling: fail-fast (exception on validation 
        error), error-collecting, or a combination (collect up to 50 first 
        errors).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Related to the validation system re-design, the native DTD validator 
      implementation was also rewritten. The result is fully conformant DTD 
      validator, including all well-formedness checks reliably implemented. 
      Handling of the default attribute values and attribute types is now done 
      in DTD-aware but non-DTD-validating mode (unlike in 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to testing, one important part is that now code coverage testing 
      started during 3.0 development. Coverage reached 60% - 80% (for code 
      lines covered to methods covered, respectively), which should be a good 
      start going forward. And work with StaxTest Stax conformance test suite 
      (which is included with the reference implementation, and also used for 
      ref. impl. testing) improved compatibility between Woodstox and the 
      reference implementation. And finally, the unit test suite specific to 
      Woodstox itself was significantly improvede. These changes together 
      suggest that the 3.0 release will be the best test release so far, and 
      hopefully have even fewer bugs than 1.0.x and 2.0.x releases earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the feature that many developers will hopefully find tempting as 
      well is the performance. It may seem unsual that the improvements in 
      standards compliancy could go together with performance improvements, 
      but this is the case for 3.0. Changes are most noticeable when dealing 
      with small documents, since the setup overhead (which is significantly 
      reduced with 3.0) is most noticeably for such documents. Serialization 
      side has also been optimized for the first time -- whereas 1.0 and 2.0 
      focused in trying to make handling correct, 3.0 development cycle 
      included time for performance improvements. And the results are well 
      worth the time spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all 3.0 release will hopefully be another big step for Woodstox: 
      the quality and reliability should be even better than those of 2.0. The 
      configurability and feature sets are improved. And all this while 
      increasing performance!

      Ok, I'll give up! After struggling financially for weeks, it has become 
      financially impossible for me to do this all with my limited low-paying 
      job as a small little code monkey. So I have let myself become a 
      capitalists' lackey, and installed somce additional decorations that you 
      can see on the right side of the textual content. Please give a big 
      round of applause to mr. G. Welcome, sir, and may you have mercy on my 
      blog site. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously though, I hope the Ads you may vaguely notice on one of side 
      of your field of vision do not distract you too much. They are added in 
      the hopes that they may cover part of the modest on-going hosting 
      expenses [editor's note: big round of applause to our nice hosting 
      provider, <a title="Web Intellects" name="web-intellects" href="http://www.webintellects.com/">Web 
      Intellects</a>&#160; -- and no, this one is not a paid placement, we are just 
      happy small customers]. Depending on how this all works out, I will do 
      my best to limit screen real estate taken by all this additional 
      decorative material.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after this brief interruption, back to our regular programming.

			<h3 class="entry-header">3 Simple Rules for Fast XML-processing using Stax (aka "How to make Woodstox fly")</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Although streaming XML-processing (including both SAX event-based &quot;push 
      parsing&quot;, and Stax cursor-based &quot;pull parsing&quot;) has potentially high 
      processing throughput (in the range of over 10 megabytes per second), in 
      practice many developers end up with sub-standard performance. Why is 
      this the case?
    </p>
    <p>
      One important issue is that there are many functionally correct, but 
      inefficient way of doing the processing. Often API documentation does or 
      can not indicate optimal ways &#8212; after all, many performance 
      characteristics are implementation dependant. But in practice, there are 
      certain usage patterns that are most likely to have good performance 
      characteristics. Following list contains 3 simple general rules, with 
      examples of applicability, that can have significant positive 
      performance impact when using <a title="Woodstox" name="Woodstox" href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a>&#160;Stax-processor. 
      They are also likely to help with other implementations, and at the very 
      least should not have negative effects. These rules are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be green: reuse components that are designed to be reusable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't do processor's job, just give it enough information (&quot;tell me 
        what to do, not how do it&quot;).
      </li>
      <li>
        Close what you have opened.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Above rules can be considered to be in rough priority order: the first 
      rule will very likely have effect on all implementations. But beyond 
      potential performance benefits, the other two rules are actually also 
      general good programming practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, above rules are just loose principles, guidelines that may not 
      be of much immediate use. So what practical examples are there about 
      following the rules? Here are the examples I can think of.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Component reuse:

        <ul>
          <li>
            With Stax this is quite easy, since most objects can not be reused 
            (no methods to reset things), and those that can usually should be 
            reused.
          </li>
          <li>
            The main class of reusable Stax objects are factories: 
            XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory. Although Stax specification 
            itself is not specific regarding thread safety (or lack thereof) 
            of these factories, all existing open source implementations 
            follow the same pattern: factories are not guaranteed to be 
            thread-safe when they are configured, but they are afterwards, 
            when only reader/writer creating factory methods are used. So as 
            long as you do configuration from a single thread (possibly from 
            static initializer of a class, or constructor of a singleton 
            object) and complete it before calling the factory methods, you 
            can safely keep reusing the factory, to produce stream/event 
            readers and writers from multiple non-synchronized threads.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are 2 main reasons for performance benefits of reusing input 
            and output factories:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Implementation discovery overhead when instantiating factory 
                objects via XMLXxxFactory.newInstance() method. The dynamic 
                way Stax API uses for finding out which Stax API 
                implementation to use is very versatile and dynamic &#8212; and also 
                very slow. It may take multiple milliseconds for it to 
                introspect which jar contains the implementation, and for 
                small documents, this overhead is bigger than time it takes to 
                process the content itself! (for example, with parsing speed 
                of 10 MBps, parsing a 1k SOAP message takes about 0.1 
                milliseconds: contrast that to, say, 5 millisecond overhead of 
                factory instantiation!). So even if you could not reuse the 
                factory, you may at the very least keep reference to the 
                actual factory class, and call Class.newInstance() instead 
                (which avoids the excessive overhead as it is just a regular 
                reflection call). It is worth noting that similar overhead is 
                incurred when using JAXP or SAX APIs, when dynamically 
                constructing implementation objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Per-factory caching: some caching schemes implementations use 
                (specifically, symbol table reusing and DTD caching Woodstox 
                uses) are done on per-factory basis. Access to these caches is 
                properly synchronized and thread-safe, but can not function 
                efficiently unless readers and writers are produced by the 
                same factory: new instances start with empty caches.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Factory instance reuse (as with most other optimizations) has most 
            significant relative effect when processing small documents. In 
            such cases, overall throughput with reuse can be twice as high, or 
            more, when properly reusing input and output factories.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Giving processor information, but let it do its job:

        <ul>
          <li>
            The most obvious example of this rule is that if you have an 
            InputStream that can be used to access XML content to parser, do 
            not try to help stream reader by constructing a Reader for it 
            (unless you have specific functional need for it). It is likely 
            that the input factory can actually find a more optimal Reader 
            implementation. It may also be able to reuse internal Reader 
            buffers (esp. when coupled with &quot;close your streams&quot;, see below).
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, in cases where you can pass just a reference (like URL, 
            or File), it is better to pass that reference instead of trying to 
            construct a Reader, or even InputStream. Although basic Stax 1.0 
            API does not have such methods, some implementations have 
            additional methods (Woodstox, for example, has its own &quot;Stax2&quot; set 
            of extensions) that allow passing such references for constructing 
            instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving processor enough information, however, is important: for 
            example, if you do know what the encoding of content should be, it 
            is a good idea to pass that to the factory method (if possible). 
            Implementation can then use it if and as necessary.
          </li>
          <ul>
            
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Closing what you have opened:

        <ul>
          <li>
            This is a simple common sense rule, but it can also have positive 
            performance impact. For example, Woodstox can reuse some of its 
            internal data structures if it knows when caller is done with a 
            stream/event reader: once a reader or writer is closed, it can not 
            be used any further. Although it is sometimes possible for the 
            implementation to know when active use ends (for example, when 
            END_DOCUMENT is returned by a stream reader, no further 
            information can be retrieved), it is better to explicitly declare 
            end of active use. This can be done by calling 
            XMLStreamReader.close() (and similarly for event reader, and 
            stream/event writers).
          </li>
          <li>
            As with factory object reuse, the effects of internal data 
            structure reuse by implementations is most significant for small 
            documents: doubled throughput is possible for documents of size 1 
            kB.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given all of above, how much does this really matter? For small 
      documents (in 1 - 2 kilobyte range), difference in throughput between 
      the optimal usage, and the slowest naive (but functionally correct) 
      approach can be up to 5 times (and even more for the degenerate case of 
      calls to XMLInputFactory.newInstance() for each instance created). So it 
      is probably worth following up these simple rules.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Let's talk about Stax!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Although the third standard Java API for XML processing, Stax, was 
      specified a while ago (JSR-173 final release happened on 25 March 2004), 
      not much has been written about it, or its usage. There are some 
      articles, and tutorials, but in generally they only touch the surface. 
      These were also mostly written around time the specification was 
      finalized (or sometimes before), and as such do not cover latest 
      developments regarding the current state of the implementations. Much 
      has changed since early 2004, in positive way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is unfortunate, since this API (or in general, type of XML 
      processing it defines, often called &quot;pull parsing&quot;) offers significant 
      benefits for many types of XML processing tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of articles, and documentation in general has many reasons. 
      Among these are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After initial interest in Stax, and articles, problems were found with 
        the reference implementation. The development of the RI also seemed 
        stagnant. This may have left early adopters disillusioned, and perhaps 
        also indicated that possibilities of Stax implementations themselves 
        are limited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers who have interest in and use for Stax are generally more 
        experienced developers, and reasonably quickly managed to solve the 
        immediate problems they had (or abandon the approach); either way, 
        there is little need for tutorial after one has to dig deep in the 
        code, or has lost the interest in the API as whole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Low-level XML processing in general is often not needed: as long as 
        there are higher level processing systems (such as XSL for 
        transformations, XMLBeans and JAXB for data binding, various SOAP 
        libraries for SOAP processing), it is possible for developers to have 
        fully functioning systems without ever directly manipulating XML 
        content. In this regard Stax is similar to Sax: both offer access to 
        XML at the lowest possible abstraction level. The reason, then, for 
        little being written could be that there is no perceived need.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But I believe it would be very useful to get more and more accessible 
      content regarding Stax API itself, as well as the current state of and 
      plans for the actively developed implementations. Regarding issues 
      listed above:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since the reference implementation was released and open source, 2 new 
        actively maintained implementations have been released, both of which 
        surpass functionality and quality of the reference implementation:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a title="Woodstox" href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org" name="woodstox">Woodstox</a> 
          Open Source implementation
        </li>
        <li>
          <a title="Sun Java Streaming Xml Parser" href="https://sjsxp.dev.java.net/" name="sjsxp">Sun 
          Java Streaming Xml Parser</a> (SJSXP)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Even the experienced developers would benefit a lot from learning 
        about some of more subtle issues regarding Stax implementations. For 
        example, even though Stax API defines functionally how things should 
        work, there are often multiple functionally equivalent ways of doings 
        things, with varying efficiency. It is not necessarily clear, without 
        further documentation, which are the &quot;best practices&quot; of doing things. 
        Since Stax processing is potentially the fastest way to process XML 
        from Java, performance differences are often more important with Stax, 
        than with higher level tools.Al
      </li>
      <li>
        Although it is often not necessary to process XML at the lowest 
        possible level, it is still useful to know how to do it when it is 
        necessary. For example, there are currently few higher-level libraries 
        or tools that can operate with documents whose size exceeds available 
        memory. Since streaming processing (that both SAX and Stax can do) can 
        do just this, it is very useful to know about approaches. And since 
        both SAX and Stax have their own pros and cons (both at API and 
        implementation level), general knowledge of Stax should prove useful 
        for anyone dealing with XML on Java platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So... It is all nice to talk about writing about Stax. But wouldn't it 
      be better to actually write about the dang thing? As an author of 
      Woodstox, I am in good position to try to do my share by writing about 
      thing or two I know about Stax, Woodstox, performance tricks and tips, 
      and all related things. So how about we &quot;Talk About Stax&quot;? (&quot;... Let's 
      talk about all the good things, And the bad things that may be...&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned: I will start writing things I have meant to document for a 
      long time, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How to REALLY use the XMLStreamWriter (&quot;Repairing WHAT mode?&quot;)
      </li>
      <li>
        What matters with respect to speed: aka &quot;How to make my XML processing 
        code fly&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        How do I validate documents?
      </li>
      <li>
        What's new with Woodstox &quot;experimental&quot; Stax2 extension to basic Stax 
        API.
      </li>
      <li>
        How can I customize quoting of characters with XMLStreamWriter
      </li>
      <li>
        Is Stax really fast? How about binary encodings, like the Fast 
        Infoset, is that really fast?
      </li>
    </ul></p>
