     <h3 class="entry-header">Basic flaw with most binary formats: missing identifiable prefix (protobuf, Thrift, BSON, Avro, MsgPack)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Ok: I admit that I have many reservations regarding many existing binary 
      data formats; and this is major reason why I worked on <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormat">Smile 
      format</a> specification -- to develop a format that tries to address 
      various deficiencies I have observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the full list of grievances would be long, I realized today 
      that there is one basic design problem that is common to pretty much all 
      formats -- at least Thrift, protobuf, BSON and MsgPack -- that is: lack 
      of any kind of reliable, identifiable prefix. Commonly used techniques 
      like &quot;magic number&quot;, which is used to allow reliable type detection for 
      things like image formats appears unknown to binary data format 
      designers. This is a shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. The Problem</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a piece of data (file, web resource), one important piece of 
      metadata is its structure. While this is often available explicitly from 
      the context, this is not always the case; and even if it could be added 
      there are benefits to being able to automatically detect type: this can 
      significantly simplify systems, or to extend functionality by accepting 
      multiple kinds of formats. Various graphics programs, for example, can 
      operate on different image storage formats, without necessarily having 
      any metadata available beyond just actual data.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why does this matter? It helps in verifying basic correctness of 
      interacton in many cases: if you can detect what is and what is not 
      valid piece of data in a format, life is much easier: you have a chance 
      to know immediately when piece of data is completely corrupt, or you are 
      being fed data in some format than the one you expect. Or, if you 
      support multiple formats, you can add automatic handling of differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Textual formats do it well</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But let's go back to commonly used textual data formats: XML and JSON. 
      Of these, XML specifies &quot;xml declaration&quot; which can be used to not only 
      determine text encoding (UTF-8 etc) used but also the fact that data is 
      XML. It is cleanly designed and is simple to implement. As if it was 
      designed by people who knew what they were doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JSON does not define such a prefix, but specification does specify exact 
      rules for detecting valid JSON, as well as encodings that can be used; 
      so in practice JSON auto-detection is as easy to implement as that for 
      XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. But most new binary formats don't</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now; the task of defining unique (enough) header for binary formats 
      would be even easier than that for textual formats, because structurally 
      there is less variance: no need to allow variable text encoding, 
      arbitrary white spaces, or other lexical sugar. It took me very little 
      time to figure out the simple schema used by Smile to indicate its type 
      (which in itself was inspired by design of PNG image format, an example 
      of very good data format design).
    </p>
    <p>
      So you might think that binary formats would excel in this area. 
      Unfortunately, you would be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I can see, following binary data formats have little or no 
      support for type detection:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Thrift</b> does not seem to have type identifier at its format 
        layer. There is actually small amount of metadata at RPC level (there 
        is a message-start structure of some kind), but this only helps if you 
        want/need to use Thrift's RPC layer. Another odd things is that 
        internal API actually exposes hooks that would be used to handle any 
        type idenfitiers; it is as if designers were at least aware of 
        possibility of using some markers to enclose main-level data entities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>protobuf</b> does not seem to have anything to allow type detection 
        of a given blob of protobuf data. I guess protobuf never claimed to be 
        useful for anything beyond tightly coupled low-level system 
        integration (although some clueless companies are apparently using it 
        for data storage... which just plain old Bad Idea), so maybe I could 
        buy argument that this is just not needed, that there is never any 
        &quot;arbitrary protobuf data&quot; around. Still... adding a tiny bit of 
        redundancy would make sense for diagnostics purposes; and given that 
        protobuf already has some redundancy (field ids, instead of using 
        ordering) it would seem acceptable to use first 2 or 4 bytes for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MsgPack</b> and <b>BSON</b> both just define &quot;raw&quot; encoding, 
        without any format identifier that I can see. This is especially 
        puzzling since unlike protobuf and Thrift, they do not require a 
        schema to be used; that is, they have plenty of other metadata (types, 
        names of struct members; even length prefixes). So make these data 
        formats completely  unidentifiable?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>4. But what about Avro?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one exception aside from Smile, however. Avro seems to do the 
      right thing (as far as I can read <a href="http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.4.1/spec.html">the 
      specification</a>) -- at least when explicitly storing Avro data in a 
      file (I assume including map/reduce use cases, stored in HDFS): there is 
      a simple prefix to use, as well as requirement to store the schema used. 
      This makes sense, since my biggest concern with formats like protobuf 
      and Thrift is that being &quot;schema-ridden&quot;, data without schema is all but 
      useless. Requiring that two are bundled -- when stored -- makes sense; 
      optimizations can be used for transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Avro definitely seems better design than 4 other binary data formats 
      listed above in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Why do I care?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of my on-going expansion of Jackson (&quot;the universal data 
      processor&quot;), I am thinking of adding many more backends (to support 
      reading and writing data in alternate data formats), to allow clean and 
      efficient data binding to/from most any commonly used data formats. 
      Ideally this would include binary data formats. Current plans are to 
      include format detection functionality in such a way that new codecs can 
      detect data they are capable of reading and writing; and this will work 
      just fine for most existing formats that Jackson can handle (JSON, 
      Smile, XML). I also assumed that since it would be very easy to design 
      data formats that can be reliably detected, existing formats should be a 
      piece of cake to detect. It is only when I started digging into details 
      of binary data formats that the sad reality sunk in...
    </p>
    <p>
      On plus side, this makes it easier to focus on adding first rate support 
      for data formats that are easy to detect. So I will probably prioritize 
      Avro compatibility significantly higher than others; and I will 
      unfortunately have to downgrade my work on adding Thrift support which 
      would otherwise be the most important &quot;alien&quot; format to support (due to 
      existing use by infrastructure I am working on).

      (note: related to original &quot;<a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2010/05/entry_400.html">on

      retrospect</a> entry)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What was the plan again?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, it has been almost 4 months since my last medium-term high-level 
      priorization overview. Planned list back then had these entries:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Woodstox 4.1
      </li>
      <li>
        Aalto 1.0 (complete async API, impl)
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson 1.7: focus on extensibility
      </li>
      <li>
        ClassMate 1.0
      </li>
      <li>
        Externalized Mr Bean (not dependant on Jackson)
      </li>
      <li>
        StaxMate 2.1
      </li>
      <li>
        Tr13 1.0
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>2. And how have we done?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks like we got about half of it done. Point by point:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        DONE: Woodstox 4.1 (with 4.1.1 patch release)
      </li>
      <li>
        Almost: Aalto 1.0 -- half-done; but significant progress, API is 
        defined, about half of implementation work done
      </li>
      <li>
        DONE: Jackson 1.7 (with 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 patch releases)
      </li>
      <li>
        Almost: ClassMate 1.0 not completed; version 0.5.2 released, javadocs 
        publisher, minor work remains
      </li>
      <li>
        Deferred: Externalized Mr Bean -- no work done (only some preliminary 
        scoping)
      </li>
      <li>
        DONE? StaxMate 2.1 -- released 2.0.1 patch instead that contains fixes 
        to found issues, but no new features, which would defined 2.1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some work done: Tr13: incremental work, but no definite 1.0 release 
        (did release 0.2.5 patch version with cleanup)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I guess it is less than half since only 2 things were fully completed 
      (or 3 if StaxMate 2.0.1 counts). But then again, of remaining tasks only 
      one did not progress at all; and many are close to being completed (in 
      fact, I was hoping to wrap up Aalto before doing update). And ones 
      referred were lower entries on the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I did work on a few things that were not on the list. 
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Started &quot;jackson-xml-databinding&quot; project (after Jackson 1.7.0), got 
        first working version (0.5.0)
      </li>
      <li>
        Started multiple other Jackson extension projects 
        (jackson-module-hibernate, jackson-module-scala), with working builds 
        and somewhat usable code; these based on code contributed by other 
        Jackson developers
      </li>
      <li>
        Started &quot;java-cachemate&quot; project, designed concept and implemented 
        in-memory size-limited-LRU-cache (used already in a production system)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This just underlines how non-linear open source development can be; it 
      is often opportunistic -- but necessarily in negative way -- and heavily 
      influenced by feedback, as well as newly discovered inter-dependencies, 
      and -opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Updated list</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's try guestimating what to do going forward, then, shall we. 
      Starting with leftovers, we could get something like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Aalto 1.0: complete async implementation; do some marketing
      </li>
      <li>
        ClassMate 1.0: relatively small amount of work (expose class 
        annotations)
      </li>
      <li>
        Java CacheMate: complete functionality, ideally release 1.0 version
      </li>
      <li>
        Tr13: either complete 1.0, or augment with persistence options from 
        cachemate (above)
      </li>
      <li>
        Externalized Mr Bean? This is heavily dependant on external interest
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson 1.8: target most-wanted features (maybe external type id, 
        multi-arg setters)
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson-xml-databinding 1.0: more testing, fix couple known issues
      </li>
      <li>
        Work on Smile format; try to help with libsmile (C impl), maybe more 
        formal specification; performance measurements, other advocacy; maybe 
        even write a javascript codec
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other potential work could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        StaxMate 2.1 with some new functionality
      </li>
      <li>
        Woodstox 5.0, if there is interest (raise JDK minimum to 1.5, maybe 
        convert to Maven build)
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson-module-scala: help drive 1.0 version, due to amount of 
        interest in full Scala support
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson-module-csv: support data-binding to/from CSV -- perhaps 
        surprisingly, much of &quot;big data&quot; exists as plain old CSV files...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But chances are that above lists are also incomplete... let's check back 
      in May, on our first &quot;anniversary&quot; retrospect.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Why do modularity, extensibility, matter?</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      After writing about <a href="/blog/archives/2011/02/entry_441.html">Jackson 
      1.7 release</a>, I realized that while I described what and how was done 
      to significantly improve modularity and extensibility of Jackson, I did 
      not talk much about why I felt both were desperately needed. So let's 
      augment that entry with bit more background, fill in the blanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things actually go together such that while modularity in itself is 
      somewhat useful, it is extremely important when it is coupled with 
      extensibility (and conversely it is hard to be extensible without being 
      modular). So I will consider them together, as &quot;modular extensibility&quot;, 
      in what follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Distributed development</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious short-term benefit of better modularization, 
      extensibility, is that it actually allows simple form of distributed 
      development, as additional extension modules (and projects under which 
      they are created) can be built independent from the core project. There 
      are dependencies, of course -- modules may need certain features of the 
      core library -- but this much looser coupling than having to actually 
      work within same codebase, coordinating changes. This alone would be 
      worth the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the need for distribution stems from the obvious challenge with 
      Jackson's (or any smilar project's) status quo: that the core project, 
      and its author (me) can easily become a bottleneck. This is due to 
      coordination needed, such as code reviews, patch integration; much of 
      which is most efficiently done with simple stop-and-wait'ish approach. 
      While it is possible to increase concurrency within one project and 
      codebase (with lots of additional coordination, communication, both of 
      which are hard if activity levels of participants fluctuate), it is much 
      easier and more efficient to do this by separate projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all projects can take the route we are taking, since one reason such 
      modularity is possible is due to expansion of the project scope: 
      extensions for new datatypes are &quot;naturally modular&quot; (conceptually at 
      least; implementation-wise this is only now becoming true), and 
      similarly support for non-Java JVM languages (Scala, Clojure, JRuby) and 
      non-JSON data formats (BSON, xml, Smle). But there are many projects 
      that could benefit from more focus on modular extensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Reduced coupling leads to more efficient develo[ment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced coupling between pieces of functionality in turn allows for much 
      more efficient development. This is due to multiple factors: less need 
      for coordination; efficiency in working on smaller pieces (bigger 
      projects, as companies, have much more inherent overhead, lower 
      productivity); shorter release cycles. Or, instead of canonically 
      shorter development and release cycles, it is more accurate to talk 
      about more optimal cycles: new, active projects can have shorter cycles, 
      release more often, and more mature, slower moving (or ones with more 
      established user base and hence bigger risks from regression) can choose 
      slower pace. The key point is that each project can choose most optimal 
      rate of releases, and only synchronize when some fundamental &quot;platform&quot; 
      functionality is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, core Jackson project has released a significant new 
      version every 3 - 6 months. While this is pretty respectable rate in 
      itself, it is glacial pace compared to releases for, say, 
      &quot;jackson-xml-databinding&quot; module, which might release new versions on 
      weekly basis before reaching its 1.0 version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Extending and expanding community</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This improved efficiency is good just in itself, but I think it will 
      actually make it easire to extend and expand community. Why? Because 
      starting new projects and getting releases out faster should make it 
      easier to join, get started and productive, and thereby lower threshold 
      for participation. In fact I think that we are going to quickly double 
      and quadruple number of active contributors quite soon, when everyone 
      realizes potential for change; how easy it is to get to expand 
      functionality in a way that everyone can share the fruits of labor. 
      Previously best methods have been to write a blog entry about using a 
      feature, or maybe report a bug; but now it will be trivially easy to 
      start playing with new kinds of reusable extension functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Modules are the new core</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given all the benefits of the increased modularity I am even thinking of 
      further splitting much of existing &quot;core&quot; (meaning all components under 
      main Jackson project; core, mapper, xc, jax-rs, mrbean, smile) as 
      modules. All jars except for core and mapper would themselves work as 
      modules (or similar extensions); and many features of mapper jar could 
      be extracted out. The main reason for doing this would actually be to 
      allow different release cycles: jax-rs component, for example, has 
      changed relatively little since 1.0: there is no real need to release 
      new version of it every time there is a new mapper version. In fact, of 
      6 jars, mapper is the only one that is constantly changing; others have 
      evolved at much slower pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even if core components were to stay within core Jackson project, 
      most new extension functionality to be written will be done as new 
      modules.

     <h3 class="entry-header">On Perception of Java Verbosity</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Today many software developers consider Java to be the modern-day 
      equivalent of Cobol. This is evident from comments comparing amount of 
      Java code needed to do tasks that can be written as one-liners using 
      more dynamic and expressive scripting languages such as Python or Ruby. 
      Funny how time flies -- it wasn't all THAT long ago that Java was seen 
      as relatively concise language compared to C, due to its in-built 
      support for things like garbage collection and standard library that 
      contained implementations for host of things that in C were DIY (note 
      that I did not say &quot;due to simplicity of language itself&quot;)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Java verbose?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But while it is true that Java syntax can lead to code much more verbose 
      than seems prudent (especially when traversing and modifying data 
      structures), sometimes its reputation exceeds reality. I was reminded by 
      this by a tweet I came across. The tweet asked &quot;and how many lines would 
      this be in Java&quot;, regarding a task of downloading JSON from a URL and 
      parsing contents to extract data; something that can be done with a 
      single line of Python (or Ruby or Perl). Implied assumption being be 
      that it would take many more lines of Java code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Ain't necessarily so</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This assumption is not completely baseless: if a developer was to do 
      this as part of a service, a typical java developer might well end up 
      with code that exceeded ten lines; and this even without code itself 
      being badly written. I will come back to question of &quot;why&quot; in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      But assumption is also off base, for the simple reason that it can be a 
      one-liner even in Java; for example:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>Response resp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(new URL(&quot;http://dot.com/api/?customerId=1234&quot;).openStream(),Response.class);<br>
// or if you prefer, bind similarly as &quot;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&quot;  </pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      (and in fact, &quot;.openConnection()&quot; is actually unnecesary, as 
      ObjectMapper can just take URL -- but if it didn't, one can open 
      InputStream directly from URL, which sends request, takes response and 
      so forth).
    </p>
    <p>
      Code snippet just uses standard JDK URLConnection via URL, and a JSON 
      library (Jackson in this case, but might as well be, GSon, flex-json, 
      whatever); and results in request being made, contents read, parsed and 
      bound to an object of caller's choosing, either a Plain Old Java Object, 
      or simple Map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that it IS that simple, why was there assumption that something 
      more was needed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. But often is</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above use case happens to be doable in quite concise form; but there are 
      other tasks where Java equivalent ends up being either a call to a very 
      specific library tailored to condense usage, or is much fluffier than 
      equivalents in modern scripting languages. But I don't think this is the 
      main reason for the universal appearance of Java's bloatedness, i.e. it 
      is not just case of choosing a wrong example.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it is because most Java developers would actually write piece of 
      code that spanned more than a dozen lines of code. Why? Either because:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They didn't know JDK or libraries, and use much more cumbersome 
        methods (case for less experienced developers)
      </li>
      <li>
        They actually understand complexities of the task, within context 
        where task needs to be done.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      First one is easy to understand: if you don't know your tools, you can't 
      expect a good outcome. But second point needs more explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's consider the same task of sending a request to a service that 
      returns a JSON response that we need to return as an object. What 
      possible additional things should we cover, beyond what one-liner did? 
      Here's sampling of possible issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is no error handling in code snippet: if there are transient 
        problems with connection, it will just fail for good, regardless of 
        type of problem there is
      </li>
      <li>
        How about problems with service itself? Requesting unknown customer? 
        Do we get an HTTP error response; different JSON or what?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we really want to wait for unspecified amount of time, if request 
        can not be made (TCP will try its damnest to connect, so it there is 
        an outage it'll be minutes before anything fails)
      </li>
      <li>
        URL to connect to is fixed (and hard-coded), including parameters to 
        send; should they really be hard-coded
      </li>
      <li>
        How is caching handled? What are connection details?
      </li>
      <li>
        When there are failures, who is notified and how?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are we happy with the default JDK URLConnection? It may not work all 
        that well for some use cases (i.e. shouldn't be using Apache 
        httpclient or something)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To cover such concerns for production systems, one probably would want 
      much more complicated handling: possible retries for transient errors; 
      definitely logging to indicate hard failures; way to handle error 
      responses and indicates those to caller. Due to testing, end points 
      being used are typically dynamically determined and passed; connection 
      settings may need to be changed, and sometimes different parameters need 
      to be sent. And for production systems we probably need more caching; 
      whereas during testing we may want to disable any and all caching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there are often many more aspects to cover, there is then tendendy 
      to wrap all calls within helper objects or functionality; and if we did 
      define something like &quot;fetchJSONDataFromURL()&quot;, it surely would end up 
      being more than dozen of lines of code. Yet calling functionality might 
      still be no longer than a single Java statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      So which one should we focus on? Helper method that is, say 50 lines 
      long; or call to use it, which may be a one-liner? Former is what can be 
      used to &quot;prove&quot; how bloated Java code is; yet it is written just once, 
      whereas one-liners to use it are written ideally much more often.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, above is not meant to say that it is ALWAYS necessary to 
      handle all kinds of obscure error modes, or to create perfect system 
      that is as efficient as possible. It is clearly not, and Java developers 
      seem especially prone to over-complicating and -engineering solutions. 
      But in other cases, happy-go-lucky approach (that I would claim is more 
      common with &quot;perl scripters&quot;) won't do. This is just a long way of 
      saying that complexity of code should be based on actual requirements; 
      and that those requirements vary widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Concise Java by Composition</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my insight (if any) here is this: since Java, the language, 
      offers relatively in way of writing compact code, economical source code 
      must come from proper use of libraries, as well as design of those 
      libraries. Furthermore, I think many Java developers have started 
      wrongly believing that Java code must be verbose; and that this makes 
      perception more of a self-fulfilling prophecy. This means that to write 
      compact Java code one absolutely MUST be familiar with libraries to use 
      for things that JDK does not support well (or at all).
    </p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Experiments with advertising, Adsense vs Adbrite, experience so far</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      It has been a while -- <a href="/blog/archives/2010/06/entry_403.html">almost 
      6 months</a>, to be precise -- since I decided to see if there is more 
      to on-line advertising than venerable Google AdSense. So it is time to 
      see if I have learnt anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Summary: gain some, lose some</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      An overall verdict is pretty much inconclusive: I like some aspects 
      (more control, less fluctuation with revenue); but from strictly 
      monetary view point, change is mixed bag. Fortunately revenue we are 
      talking about is in &quot;trivial&quot; range -- enough so that it does not round 
      down to zero, but not enough to pay for hosting at current rates. So I 
      can freely do whatever I want without risking losing any &quot;real money&quot;. I 
      might as well just gain StackOverflow credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Positive</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall the main positive aspect for me is the feeling of empowerment: 
      AdBrite gives more control for publisher, from controlling what to 
      display to defining minimum bids, and even allowing fallbacks 
      (typically, to, what else but AdSense!). I like this a lot, and would 
      assume it is a non-trivial competitive advantage as well: whereas for me 
      control is more of a nice-to-have, I know for a fact that bigger 
      &quot;serious&quot; publisher REALLY want to have more control. This is most 
      important for publishers with valuable brand to take care of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another smallish positive thing is that since most advertisements are 
      cost-per-display (aka cost-per-thousand == CPM), and NOT cost-per-click 
      (CPC), revenue stream is steadier. With AdSense, your revenue typically 
      fluctuates wildly, unless you get lots of direct placements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Negative</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      On downside, &quot;guaranteed&quot; revenue from CPM is not particularly high. In 
      fact, little CPM that I have seen from AdSense for others sites (not 
      this blog) is typically in the same range as what I can get from AdBrite 
      for majority of views (AB does have wider range of CPMs, based on viewer 
      profiling); and even if readers are often skimpy clickers, whenever 
      there are clicks it is typically worth more than two or three thousand 
      CPM views. So overall it is possible that AdSense might actually pay 
      more, over time (with caveat from above that either way, very little 
      money will change hands :-) ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Other</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh. One thing I was hoping to see was wider selection of interesting ads 
      to display; not just same old, same old. This may or may not be true: I 
      think that overall selection may be wider (just from looking at all the 
      ads that get displayed, via publisher management console), but selection 
      for individual profile is still rather limited. So I don't know if it's 
      very different from what Google would give. I guess it makes sense, in a 
      way, that algorithms tend to over-fit ads with (IMO) too little 
      randomity. But I really would like some more variation, personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Conclusions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been merely quite interesting ride. Perhaps I should check out 
      potentially other choices? Too bad most alternatives seem to be just 
      obnoxious irritating block-the-whole-page scams, or things that try to 
      take over links, images; things that I would personally hate to see. I 
      have no plans to introduce anything like that. But as usual, I am open 
      to things that fit in well enough; something similar to AdSense or 
      AdBrite ad systems, I guess.
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Amazon Web Service (AWS), WikiLeaks: series of unfortunate events</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      As a current Amazon Web Service customer (as well as ex-employee of 
      Amazon) I was sad to see reports of AWS mishandling of its WikiLeaks 
      hosting.<br>My main objection is not regarding whether AWS should host 
      the content or not, and I understand that due to self-service nature 
      sometimes termination need to occur after customer relationship has been 
      initially established. But the way termination came about was a complete 
      cluster and really makes me wonder if I want to continue using AWS or 
      even recommend it to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I understand, basic facts are that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        WikiLeaks started hosting content with AWS
      </li>
      <li>
        AWS was contacted by Posturing and Angry US politician(s) who wants to 
        fight WikiLeaks using intimidation tactics (&quot;you are either with us, 
        or you are with.... terrorists!&quot;). Sort of like, you know, people who 
        use terror as a weapon to further their agenda.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shortly afterwards AWS terminated hosting of said content citing 
        &quot;probable cause for copyright infringement&quot;, without actual request 
        for doing so (pro-actively) -- essentially claiming WikiLeaks was 
        &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;, but without giving them a chance to 
        present any proof.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Now: the way I see it, one of two things happened to effect step 3: 
      either Amazon agreed to do what Lieber&quot;man&quot; et al asked (but lied about 
      not having done that); or Amazon wanted to pro-actively tackle issue 
      they knew would become problematic (opportunistic), using some suitable 
      weasel-word section from the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should have happened is simple: AWS should have done nothing before 
      officials presented them with a court order or valid cease-and-desist 
      letter (or whatever equivalent is done for Patriot Act requests); and if 
      that happened, publicly announce what they did and why. This is what 
      other companies have done (Google, Yahoo). Or in cases of copyright 
      infringement, similar demand by (alleged) copyright holder, accompanied 
      with court order or whatever DMCA requires. One would think this would 
      be easy for government to do as well for content it has produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why did this not happen? Since I have no idea what sort of 
      backchannel communication resulted in what happened, best I can do is 
      speculate. My two favourite suggestions are that either someone called 
      favors; or that some mid-level manager made a panic decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painful, very painful to watch. It's as if someone gave themselves a 
      wedgie just to prevent bullies from doing it...
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Look back on "prioritizing Open Source projects" (from May 2010)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      It has been more than 4 months since I wrote about my experiences with <a href="/blog/archives/2010/05/entry_400.html">priorization 
      for Open Source projects</a>, it seems like good time to see how things 
      have been moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks like there are two ways to look at things -- whether glass is half 
      full or half empty -- as I have pretty much completed 50% of tasks; but 
      not necessarily in order of priority. And this even thought I publicly 
      outlined priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One positive thing is that the top entry (Java UUID Generator 3.) was 
      just completed; and the second entry (Woodstox 4.1) is nicely in 
      progress, to be completed within a month or two. On the other hand, 
      other two completed tasks (both related to Jackson 1.6 that was 
      completed a month ago) were entries listed as having the lowest 
      priority. Some entries not on the list were also completed; specifically 
      work with <a href="http://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client">Async 
      HTTP Client</a> and OAuth signature calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess I think this is reasonable outcome, as priority lists for my 
      &quot;hobby&quot; development are there to help and assist, not to drive to 
      specific business goals or to rein in my creativity. So even more 
      important than getting things done in &quot;right order&quot; is that things do 
      get done. So as long as more important or more urgent things are more 
      likely to get worked on than less important or urgent things, overall 
      efficiency remains brutally high, which is the way I like it. Finally, 
      part of the reason for fluctuating order of execution is due to some 
      tasks being more interesting than others; and working on &quot;most 
      interesting&quot; things tends to maximize amount of progress (in contrasts 
      to working on less interesting but more highly prioritized things).
    </p>
    <p>
      But to get some closure on this entry, let's consider this a completed 
      4-month Scrum and create an updated priority list. Here's what it might 
      look like:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Complete Woodstox 4.1 (XML Schema, other user requested features) -- 
        carry-over from the original list
      </li>
      <li>
        Aalto 1.0: finalize async API, implementation
      </li>
      <li>
        Jackson 1.7: focus on extensibility (module registration, contextual 
        serializers)
      </li>
      <li>
        ClassMate (1.0?) -- library for fully resolving generic types; based 
        on Jackson code
      </li>
      <li>
        External version of Mr Bean (from Jackson 1.6)
      </li>
      <li>
        StaxMate 2.1? (from the original list)
      </li>
      <li>
        Tr13 1.0? (from the original list)
      </li>
      <li>
        ... and then re-consider
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is an incomplete list and I expect roughly similar completion rate 
      if I was to look back again in 4 months. Maybe I should start doing 
      quarterly project reviews just for fun. :-)

     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">

      Ok let's talk about something that is quite visible to you dear readers, 
      but something that you have probably managed to ignore automatically. 
      Yes, I am taking about those commercial decorations on margin of these 
      pages. But please, don't change the channel quite yet. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Advertising Changes... yay!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So what's up there? After being a very small AdSense publisher for few 
      years, I figured that I might well retire before ever seeing another 
      check for ads displayed on this blog; so it might be time to explore 
      options: if not to get higher yields then at least maybe get more 
      interesting ads. I also generally root for underdogs, and at this point 
      Google is the ultimate uber-dog if there ever was one. So why not 
      partner up with some other advertising puppies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given these loose goals about the only criteria for finding a 
      replacement would be that it is not Google. And, well, ideally it should 
      not be Apple, and preferably not Microsoft. But latter two are 
      negotiable constraints (in fact, I am tempted to check out M$'s 
      PubCenter; if for nothing else due to its catchy name!).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. So... ?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough background discussion: in the end, I decided to change my ad 
      provider from the big G to an unknown-before-about-a-week-ago company 
      called <a href="http://www.adbrite.com/">AdBrite</a>. Mostly because 
      they topped this <a href="http://www.rosswalker.co.uk/adsense_top10/">Handy 
      List of Google Adsense Alternatives</a>. And finally, as of today, I 
      bothered to change blog templates for the change to take effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Can hardly contain my excitement &lt;yawn&gt;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I am curious to see to what kind of ads they might be 
      pushing to my blog. I sort of wish it was something that lots of people 
      found totally repugnant yet completely fascinating... but chances for 
      that are probably low. We'll see -- maybe I need to cycle through 
      variety of ad sales networks before choosing my poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Commercial Proposal by Author</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, if anyone actually wants to actually advertise here -- buy a 
      section for month-by-month advertising, selling something that actually 
      relates to something I have written about -- let me know. I am open to 
      bids and can show google analytics statistics for pricing, so you have a 
      fair idea of what you'd get.<br>The only limit I will put is that 
      monthly ad space rental fee has to be non-zero positive number in full 
      US dollars. :-)<br>(you can consider it as the auction starting price)
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Rock on Kohsuke!</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Term &quot;Rock start programmer&quot; is thrown around casually when discussing 
      best software developers. But as with music, true stars are few and far 
      between. While knowing the lifestyle can help, you got to have the 
      chops, be able to influence and inspire others, and obviously deliver 
      the goods to fill the stadiums, and data centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java enterprise programming world there are few more worthy of being 
      called a rock star than Kohsuke Kawaguchi. List of projects he has 
      single-handedly built is vast; list of projects he has contributed to 
      immense, and his coding speed mighty fast (as confirmed by his use of 
      term POTD, Project of the Day -- very very few individuals write sizable 
      systems literally in a day!). It all makes you wonder whether he is 
      actually a mere human being at all (maybe he's twin brother of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">Jon 
      Skeet</a>?!). For those not in the know, list of things he has authored 
      or contributed to contains such programming pearls such as Multi-Schema 
      Validator, Sun JAXB (v2) and JAX-WS implementations, Hudson, Maven, 
      Glassfish, Xerces, Args4j, Com4j, and so on and on (for a more complete 
      list, check out <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/kohsuke">his 
      profile at Ohloh</a>; read and weep)
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the point: it seems that mr. Kawaguchi is now <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/05/good-bye-sunoracle">moving 
      on</a> from sinking ship formerly known as Sun. This is not a sad thing 
      per se (we all gotta move on at some point), nor unexpected -- steady 
      stream of Sun people leaving Oracle has been and wil be going on for a 
      while -- but it still feels strange. End of an era in a way; gradual 
      shutting down of Sun brand. Image of a lonely cowboy riding against Sun 
      settings (pun intended) comes to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: rock on Kohsuke, onnea &amp; lycka till! I look forward to seeing 
      exactly what awesomeness you will come up with next!
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Welcome HP, So Long Dell (and don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out)</h3>

      (warning: this is another rant. Sorry!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's another improvement in my daily life: after more than a year of 
      space-shuttle-lift-off noise, short-but-brutish uptimes, and countless 
      curses, family's lean old Dell XP &quot;work&quot;station is out for good. Its 
      only agreeable attribute was its slim neat looks (and sort of neat 
      mechanism used for case, allowing its easy opening -- too bad there's 
      not much to do even if you can open it easily). Good riddance, music to 
      my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The replacement, HP Pavilion Slimline, actually looks every bit as good 
      as its predecessor. But otherwise the two are polar opposites: new box 
      is quiet, as reliable as expected (i.e., &quot;just works&quot;), and its only 
      design flaw is that it comes with an OS written by a company based in 
      Redmond. But that I can live with, since it's not my work machine. :-)<br>And 
      even Windows seems to have improved a bit between versions (new one has 
      Windows 7, previous one whatever preceded Vista).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: I just thought I'll share my distaste with Dell products (maybe 
      I should actually include &quot;not-so-good&quot; lists on my semi-professional 
      home page?) now that I am getting rid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all started couple of years ago, when I decided to stop wasting my 
      time on building my own PCs from components (which made sense after 
      college, could save some money). I figured that with time I spent 
      building PCs, and then troubleshooting problems with components,  it 
      just didn't make a whole lot of sense. And so I thought I'd go with 
      something that other customers in general had found usable: back then 
      Dell had highest customer ratings of all PC companies; and save for one 
      friend of mine (who had already fought with Dell's phone &quot;support&quot; 
      people, due to problems with memory chips that were failing; and that no 
      amount of rebooting would ever fix), I wasn't aware of huge problems 
      with the company or its products.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I found out by experience makes me suspect that the company that 
      had gotten good reviews had been abducted by aliens, and replaced by an 
      ersatz replica or something. Correlation between happy customers and 
      company that produced crap I bought just is not there. I am not talking 
      about customer support (no point calling them wrt. badly designed piece 
      of hardware, IMO, it is not not something a script-reading underpaid 
      remote helper can help a lot with), but rather about quality of 
      hardware. My experience beyond PC fiasco was that their products are 
      competitively priced, but have low quality. For example, laser printer 
      that I bought to replace trusty old Apple writer (which, after having 
      bought second hand, served us for 8 years; for total lifetime of 
      probably 15 years; and would have worked well but I couldn't find new 
      toner cartridges for reasonable prices any more!) was inexpensive, and 
      worked fine for a while. Like, maybe a year. And then broke down. The 
      only thing left are LCD monitors, which I have to admit were reasonably 
      priced, and still work. In fact both are still in active use. So I guess 
      they do produce something other than lemons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about that last sentence: I guess I could put my feelings into 
      fitting slogan: <b>Dell -- General Motors of Computers</b>.<br>Feel free 
      to quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. I am happy to admit that after kicking that incompetent CEO of 
      theirs out, HP seems to have done nice comeback. Good for them, and us.
