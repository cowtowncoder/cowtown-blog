     <h3 class="entry-header">Good news is news too: thoughts on and by 3 quality nonline magazines</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      If I have said it once, I hope I have said it a thousands times. This is 
      a fact: americans are pampered by the big, affordable selection of 
      quality magazines. Or at least they should be spoiled if they do read 
      them -- I am still not yet convinced they do, after living in the states 
      for a decade. This abundance of goodness is in contrast to selection of 
      daily newspapers; which are -- relatively speaking -- not that much to 
      write home about. It's almost immoral how much good stuff you can 
      actually read from refined-tree-based non-daily print products, for a 
      very modest fee. My specific selection of such Great Magazines contains 
      three exemplars -- Scientific American, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/">Fortune</a> 
      and <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a> 
      -- but I suspect I could easily form many more such triplets and still 
      make similar statements. My choice of three is not limited my economics 
      or supply problems, but by time constraints: I can barely keep up with 
      these three, as things are.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I digress. After being inspired by one of many outstanding articles 
      (it'll be the last one I mention in this entry, so more on that one 
      later on), I thought it be fair to review one interesting and relevant 
      article from all three. So here's Tatu's October 2009 American Magazine 
      Article review.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. How American Auto-Industry was Put In Its Proper Place</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (aka &quot;The Auto Bailout: How We Did It&quot; by Fortune)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of articles chosen, this is the most close-to-earth one. It's a 
      condensed story of how GM/Chrysler cleanup project was done by the &quot;Team 
      Auto&quot; of the US government. It's easy reading, and outlines how well 
      difficult tasks can sometimes be managed, with combination of good 
      people, right timing and perhaps bit of luck. If you had asked me to 
      predict how well process could possibly succeed -- I mean, all the facts 
      were there, and odds did not look very good -- I think I would have 
      thought it unlikely that end result could be as good as it seems to be. 
      And this not so much based on the story, which mostly explains what was 
      done and how, but based on my thinking of how these things tend to go 
      (with the level of business acumen that a software engineer can possibly 
      possess, whether that's above or below average banker's talent).
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like Fortune for articles like this: it's not a dumbed down 
      version (there are weeklies that can dumb it down a notch; and then 
      newspaper that take it to almost imbecil level; and finally TV shows 
      that do the retard-a-versions for actual illiterates), but manages to be 
      very easy reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's not all: Fortune also manages to be a good magazine due to 
      its contrarian spirit. For a business magazine it has very independent 
      spirit, and viewpoints presented are varied and if possible even 
      something I'd call fair. It also tackles relevant and non-easy issues -- 
      it's not just yet another WSJ (which itself actually may be one of few 
      examples of good newspapers; nonetheless, it's much more predictable and 
      thus less interesting with respect to non-daily news; but I guess that's 
      only fair for a DAILY newspaper).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow: that's a good read, enough said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Living On a Razor's Edge (by National Geographic Magazine)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And just so as not to get too well grounded with day-to-day (or 
      year-to-year) living, it's good to mentally teleport into another time 
      and/or place. National Geographic offers multiple articles for doing 
      that; learning about other countries, cultures, flora and fauna, and all 
      combinations thereof. Picking something to showcase is not easy: 
      multiple articles could qualify.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all things being equal, reading about Madagascar is always a safe 
      bet for learning something new and unusual. But even within those 
      expectations, the story and especially pictures that illustrate it stand 
      far apart. I mean, how would one even imagine natural constructs like 
      these cathedral-spire lookalikes? And things that live and grow on, 
      around and under them. Whoa. Besides, it's somewhat of an uplifting 
      article too, for once human development is unlikely to directly threaten 
      the thing (indirectly climate change can of course affect it, perhaps 
      destory, but that's still better than gone-in-next-five-years odds many 
      other exotic places are given)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. The Rise of Vertical Farms (by Scientific American)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (see <a href="http://www.verticalfarm.com">http://www.verticalfarm.com</a> 
      for more)
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally this is the article that got me inspired to write about 
      stuff others write about. Article itself is sort of mind-blowing: the 
      idea of having skyscrapers used for growing our food sounds decidedly 
      futuristic, somewhat like the old (and for a while now, obsoleted) 
      future predictions of how everyone by 2000 flies around by a jet pack 
      and eats food pills for energy. But when you read the article and think 
      about it, the first questions should be &quot;would it really work?&quot;, &quot;why 
      didn't <b>*I*</b> think about it?&quot; and &quot;isn't that obvious now that I 
      read it?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      I like the creativity aspect of the idea; as well as its immense 
      fashionability. One of more surprising current undercurrents of 
      progressive (and I don't mean politically leftist label here) 
      forward-looking thinking is that agriculture is actually not a thing of 
      the past, declining &quot;industry&quot;, but something that is both very 
      essential for humankind and also something that is part of the future 
      and current, as well as past. The only thing that has been declining 
      wrt. farming has been amount of population it employs; but its 
      importance hasn't really reduced over time, nor will it significantly be 
      reduced any time soon. So although there has been steady pace of R&amp;D 
      over the years, it is only becoming obvious now that farming is a big 
      thing; there are lots of things wrong with it, but with all the 
      challenges there are also gigantic opportunities. This along with more 
      mundane trends of organic-food-is-cool, bundled with 
      finally-at-last-here american environmentalist awakening is really 
      making farming Cool with a capital C.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is where this idea becomes sizzling hot: hey, not only can you 
      produce fresh food locally (where are the consumers? in cities dummy!), 
      it can be both economically beneficial, good for your health (no, not in 
      the &quot;good vibes&quot; sense of organic food but with regards to actual 
      reduction of use of pesticides, less time for spoiling etc. etc. etc.), 
      AND good for environment (less land used, less water, can recycle waste 
      water and perhaps even solids; less energy for transportation). Oh yes, 
      and also good tasting due to freshness -- fresh produce year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Common Threads (or Exercise in Deep Thinking by an Amateur 
      Philosophist/-logist)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One more interesting thing about the &quot;Big Three&quot; is that they often 
      converge around similar topics, somewhat aligned thinking, same threads; 
      sometimes it might not be trivial to even know which magazine had any 
      given article if you weren't shown it. And I don't mean this in negative 
      way -- it's not that magazines are identical, or lack identity, but 
      rather that they are varied and topic selection thereby overlaps (but is 
      not lemming-like approach of daily news). Of course, some could call 
      such convergence zeitgeist; different entities talking about similar 
      things, threads that connect things that seem unrelated (like 
      environmentalist/naturalist NG vs. business-talk of Fortune vs Geeky 
      SciAm). And cynics would claim I am just missing weekly-paced 
      groupthink. Perhaps this is part of the thing -- there being thoughts 
      floating in time (as much as I hate the word, I guess I better use it... 
      memes).
    </p>
    <p>
      But I also think there's something related to sort of national way of 
      thinking (what is the word for that again? Volkgaist?). Beyond temporal 
      similarities (wars are more relevant when they are going on, obviously; 
      significance of most events is time-bound), there is this common 
      solution-oriented approach, and choosing of similarly current topics 
      (not just fashionable, as in discussing stupid crap like celebrity 
      gossip or politician's marital prolems) is something these magazines 
      share. And most importantly: there is always this underlying faith in 
      things improving over time. I suspect this is something profoundly 
      american; something more genuine than stomach-revoltingly-plastic 
      flag-waving variety of americana.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I mean is that many articles talk about how things could be 
      improved; it is actually quite rare to read an article where the overall 
      tone is negative, much less something where things are pointed out to be 
      hopeless. One could of course claim that's just good business sense (who 
      would pay to read about bad stuff), but that's easily rebuked: selling 
      social porn and doom-and-gloom is the business of TV networks, and quite 
      a profitable plan at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, enough soap-box philosophizing (is that a word? can make it one 
      if not?). Thank you for time. And please consider subscribing to some of 
      these great affordable american magazines, if you don't already. I'd 
      rather they be around during my lifetime, and maybe even my children. 
      There'll be more time to read when I retire. :-)

      Toyota Prius was THE car I wanted back in early 2001, when I was buying 
      my first car in the US. It was so cool; and back in the day would have 
      been practical enough as well. With at most 3 people at a time to move 
      around, there's plenty of room, and cargo space was functional for food 
      stuff. But most importantly I cared about environmental aspects back 
      when it wasn't yet fashionable (... in the US, that is), and most people 
      around seemed to want something idiotic like a tacky pickup truck or 
      fugly SUV. Whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, 3+ month waiting list for purchases made it hard to even 
      find one instance to test drive, much less drive out of the lot. In 
      fact, the only thing I achieved when trying to do that was to get 2 hour 
      of high-pressure sales schpiel to get me to by a used Toyota Corolla. 
      Nothing against that dependable vehicle, but that just didn't cut it 
      (eventually I ended up buying a cute fiery red turbo beetle -- but 
      that's a whole another story).
    </p>
    <p>
      But maybe I should consider myself lucky: as detailed in <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/2009-04-22/news/the-flip-side-of-the-perfect-prius/">The 
      Flip Side of the Perfect Prius</a>, Prius owners may be in for more 
      &quot;unexpected adventures&quot; than they bargained for. Specifically, it seems 
      prone to some kind of sudden acceleration syndrome (or, as embarrassing 
      if somewhat less dangerous, &quot;total lock-up&quot; episodes). The case of 
      &quot;Prius in a creek&quot; from Colorado looks particularly creepy. And while I 
      could understand Toyota dealers' attitude for individual incidents (&quot;you 
      floored it instead of braking&quot; / &quot;just ran out of gas&quot;), number of 
      incidents, as well as type of people reporting problems suggests there 
      is something more at work here.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's very unfortunate, for something that in many ways is a harbinger 
      for cleaner tomorrow. I hope the problem, whatever it is, gets resolved.
    </p></p>

      From February issue of Scientific American (yes, they must have a time 
      machine to send this issue from the future), here's another interesting 
      environmental factoid: red meat produces biggie size environmental 
      problems in addition to clogging your arteries:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=D62A22C8-3048-8A5E-10E81DEE49138B4C">The 
      Greenhouse Hamburger</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (I so wish there was a way to deep-link into the article, but I guess 
      that's reserved for subscibers; or maybe I just haven't yet found the 
      right click path?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Or rather, what is surprising is the scale of the thing: I was well 
      aware of methane production part of bovine-based agriculture, which does 
      contribute significant punch to the greenhouse effect, along with rice 
      paddies (cows also contribute urban legend pearls such as &quot;Cows produce 
      enough methane to fill a zeppelin each day [or week?]&quot; (patently 
      untrue!) but I digress).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not know that there are estimates that put beef production (or 
      is the whole food production chain? article is ambiguous in this point) 
      at 14 - 22% of TOTAL greenhouse generation, ranking alongside with 
      transportation and industry. Another way to put things into perspective 
      is to consider that pound-by-pound cow meat produces 13x as much green 
      house impact as chicken meat; and the ratio to &quot;Idaho beef&quot; (aka spud) 
      is 57x.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like one good reason to develop further my latest 
      gastrological masterpiece, &quot;Spamofy Half-and-Half pasta&quot;. Try it, it 
      actually is pretty good: pasta sauce where protein comes evenly split 
      between Spam and Tofu. Not only healthier for you &amp; planet, but also 
      tasty, and less salty (sodium's dangers are vastly exaggerated, but it 
      does cause bloating if nothing else). :-)<br>

               <p><p>
      Let's start with the money shot: here's the link that effected me to 
      write this particular entry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=sb_success.sb_successstories2008_johnsonbraund">http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=sb_success.sb_successstories2008_johnsonbraund</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason I really like things like this is that they combine two 
      important but often conflicting aspects: economy of the project, and 
      ecological impact of the project. This is just one random link, but one 
      can't read a respectable magazine like, say, Fortune, without spotting 
      one or two each time. That's awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a closet environmentalist for years, specifically after 
      moving from the western Europe to US in late 90s. That is rather 
      typical: most people who have grown up in a lutheran, reason- and 
      reasonability-loving (&quot;everything in moderation&quot;) society should feel 
      similar nausea over this macabre era of McMansions and big fugly cars 
      (SUVs)
    </p>
    <p>
      But lately -- as in past two years or so -- there has been remarkably 
      change in the air... wind of change, to use a cliche. From around the 
      time of release of that <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inconvenient_truth/">&quot;Al 
      Gore movie&quot;</a>, things have finally started moving in the right 
      direction here on the left side of the Pond. Finally! I truly believe 
      that Churchill was right with his witty and insightful quote: &quot;<b>The 
      Americans will always do the right thing . . . After they've exhausted 
      all the alternatives</b>&quot;. That was within context of WW2, but it 
      applies equally well to US handling of the global warming, or more 
      generally to pollution as a global problem. And while some see this 
      comment as pessimistic (&quot;do these blubbering idiots always have to try 
      every wrong approach first?&quot;), I view it as optimistic. After all, not 
      everyone does the right in the end, no matter what. Plus, americans as a 
      nation tend to follow through; or at least have with the major 
      undertakings such as, well, world wars. And then, as now, the strongest 
      engine around these parts is the industro-economic one. Let's hope the 
      big wheel will start turning for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the only major remaining obstacle now is the excuse-inducing &quot;we 
      must get all countries to agree to act on this&quot; attitude -- screw that, 
      let's get to work! The rest can follow us, and we can follow, say, 
      Germany, Denmark and Spain.
