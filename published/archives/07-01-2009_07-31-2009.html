			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 1.2: BYOC (Bring Your Own Constructors)*; Use  Your Objects & Do More (with less)!</h3>

			<p><p>
      * (or Factory Methods)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. What's up, Doc?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of 2 Coolest Features of upcoming <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease12">Jackson 
      v 1.2</a> -- and <b>the</b> Top Feature by actual user requests (and 
      Jira user voting) -- is the <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonFeatureCreators">ability 
      to (finally!) use arbitrary constructors</a> and factory methods a class 
      has, for their intended purpose: constructing bean instances. And 
      specifically, constructing beans without having to mess with setter 
      methods whose sole purpose is to initialize the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if you have class like:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public class Name {
  private final String givenName, familyName;

  public Name(String given, String fam)
  {
   givenName = given;
   familyName = fam;
  }

  public String getGivenName() { return givenName; }
  public String getFamilyName() { return familyName; }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      you can actually use it (almost) as is, without having to add setters 
      and default constructor like you so far have had to:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public class Name {
  private String givenName, familyName;

<b>  // Used to have to add these:
  private Name() { }

  void setGiveName(String str) { givenName = str; }
  void setFamilyName(String str) { familyName = str; }</b>
  public String getGivenName() { return givenName; }
  public String getFamilyName() { return familyName; }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      So what is this &quot;almost&quot; part? Well, you do have to decorate the 
      constructor (or factory method) to let Jackson know which 
      constructor/factory method to use (by @JsonCreator); and bind names to 
      parameters (using @JsonProperty), like so
    </p>
    <pre>  <b>@JsonCreator</b>
  public Name(<b>@JsonProperty(&quot;givenName&quot;)</b> String given, <b>@JsonProperty(&quot;familyName&quot;)</b> String fam)</pre>
    <p>
      or, if you prefer factory methods:
    </p>
    <pre>  <b>@JsonCreator</b>
  public static Name constructIt(<b>@JsonProperty(&quot;givenName&quot;)</b> String given, <b>@JsonProperty(&quot;familyName&quot;)</b> String fam) {
 // construct and return an instance...
  }</pre>
    <p>
      and that's it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My now-resolved earlier pet peeve was the inability to use Jackson with 
      immutable value classes. Not so any more: now you can not only remove 
      the setters, but can also make member fields constructor-assigned and 
      final, i.e. value class immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Soap Box Time</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok now: after demonstrating this new, nifty and long-awaited feature, 
      let's consider why this is a Fundamentally Big Thing.<br>(ok, I may rant 
      a bit, perhaps even go monologuing a bit. Humor me here)
    </p>
    <p>
      So: this is Big, because it nicely demonstrates 2 core Jackson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo">Credo</a>s:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Use Your Objects</b> (aka &quot;Have It Your Way&quot;)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Do More</b> (with less)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>3. Jackson Credo: Use Your Objects</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (aka &quot;Have it Your Way&quot;, but that's (tm) by some fast food chain)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is directly related to those alternative data binding (or object 
      serialization) frameworks that take strict Schema-first approach.<br>This 
      includes formats like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_buffers">Protocol 
      Buffers</a>.As nifty as these frameworks are for some purposes, they 
      fundamentally want to rule their own sandbox; to the degree that objects 
      to use are &quot;<b><i>Their Objects, Not Yours</i></b><i>&quot; </i>(Tony-principle?). 
      That is: they define Their Objects, using Schema you (have to) provide. 
      And if you play nice, you just might get to borrow Their Objects for 
      your personal temporary use.<br>But make no mistake, you do NOT get to 
      provide the toys, specifically not Your Objects. It is clear who's the 
      boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson, on the other hand, is not that bossy. It lets YOU bring YOUR 
      Objects, and it'll play nicely with them, as per YOUR instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds fair? Good, since we are ready to move to the other Credo.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Jackson Credo: Do More (with less)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until version 1.1, Jackson has sort of played catch up with other 
      best-of-class data mapping/binding frameworks (and by-passed good many 
      inferior ones, but I digress). But now it is rather close to true 
      feature parity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good mature frameworks like <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> 
      are reasonably feature-filled. But one benefit Jackson has, specifically 
      wrt. JAXB, is that the data format it uses (JSON) is simpler. Simplicity 
      has many benefits, but the main thing is that it allows one to quickly 
      solve the &quot;simple&quot; parts (parsing, writing) -- without sacrificing other 
      important parts like API simplicity and performance -- and then move on 
      to more advanced (and arguably more value-additive) features.
    </p>
    <p>
      I claim that if it wasn't for complexities of XML (or, worse, 
      complexities of XML Schema). JAXB might be much more full-featured. In 
      fact, it seems little odd that it does not yet allow you to BYOC doesn't 
      it? But considering scope of what has already been (it is a HUGE 
      undertaking, akin to building a cathedral), it would be unfair to blame 
      its creators. At some point you have done enough and move on. I gather 
      that point was reached at some point in the past. So with all the 
      usefulness, project is realistically in maintenance mode: good, stable, 
      but not going anywhere fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the important point here is that this point has not at all been 
      reached with Jackson; nor is it likely to be reached any time soon. In 
      fact, there is a <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JACKSON">boatload 
      of New Features</a> to consider for many new releases; and solid plan to 
      get there; to develop new useful things, and have some fun along the 
      way. We plan to enjoy the ride, so hang on loosely and enjoy the new 
      scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and the &quot;with less&quot; part is mostly meant to related to YOU having to 
      do less; but it also applies to part of JSON itself providing less, but 
      perhaps counter-intuitively making the whole package offer much more. I 
      think there's some fundamentally neat principle hidden down there; but 
      that's, as they, another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Next Up: Mix-in Annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok; and after introducing this allegedly cool new feature, be prepared 
      to get your mind blown with next entry: we will be visiting the Feature 
      Known as &quot;Mix-in Annotations&quot;. Stay tuned!
    </p></p>

<div class="entry" id="post-302">
			<h3 class="entry-header">Bean Validation API looks good, even after reading the spec</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Here's another update: I wrote <a href="/blog/archives/2009/05/entry_245.html">a 
      bit</a> about Bean Validation API (jsr-303) earlier, suggesting it might 
      be something to look for.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo + behold, after finally taking time to read the underlying JSR 
      specification (still a draft, not finalized, but rather complete it 
      seems), I still like it! In fact, I think it's amongst the best JSRs I 
      have read (granted, I have read but maybe dozen all in all -- quality of 
      other hundred or so completed ones I can only speculate freely about).
    </p>
    <p>
      So why is it good? Here are some reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Its scope is well-defined: the thing covers validation of beans, and 
        only limited number of additions (like localization of error messages 
        -- not needed for all use cases, but is for the &quot;obvious&quot; case of 
        validating user input)
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;New&quot; language features (like generics, annotations, enums) are used 
        professionally: used when useful and/or necessary, but not going wild 
        for sake of using them
      </li>
      <li>
        Innovative design within above bounds
      </li>
      <li>
        Specification itself is well-written as a technical document: concise, 
        formal (enough) but readable (enough non-toy-examples, but not too 
        many)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I am especially intrigued by #3: I think the way that validator 
      factories are constructed is sensible, clever, and a clear improvement 
      over way that many earlier JSRs defined creation of factories (like JAXP 
      et al). The innovation parts is that instead of first locating a factory 
      implementation and returning it for application to configure, order is 
      actually reversed: process starts by constructing configuration object, 
      and after it has been built (using fluent/fluid/builder style), only 
      then the factory is created. The beauty of this is that the <b>resulting 
      factory is immutable and hence thread-safe</b> (and specified to be so 
      by the specs). Why is this such a big deal? Because it is now possible 
      to safely instantiate just one (or at most couple) of such factories, to 
      be shared by the whole application or subsystem. Although this can be 
      done de factor for most factories (JAXB, DOM, Stax etc etc), this is not 
      guaranteed by respective specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      But benefits of this style extend beyond thread-safety part: it also 
      allows for clean way of adding custom configurations (with help of using 
      generics to define configurator objects), with bit more type safety. If 
      you do know the provider to use (or at least extension(s) it defines), 
      you can configure things, but still within same framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      If above description seems fuzzy, go ahead and read the specification. 
      It should make more sense, especially if you have had to create such 
      pluggable-provider-factory frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So anyway, hats off to writers of JSR-303. I hope other aspiring (or 
      veteran) JSR members will learn from it.
    </p></p>

      Well, although <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5312052/top-10-tips-and-tricks-for-better-coffee">this 
      article</a> (&quot;Top 10 Tips and Tricks for Better Coffee&quot;) does NOT claim

      code, I mean, coffee, quality! :-)<br>Interesting reading, and readily 
      applicable. Sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... and if (read: when) it works, what you will see is a significant 
      incremental revenue for a <a href="http://amazon.com">well-known general

      shares based on this tip &amp; thank me later when you have earned a fortune 
      due to rocket-like run on share price after said revenue increase. It's 
      a good investment at any rate, and planned to pay for my next year home

      I assume this was inevitable: question(s) are now emerging regarding <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/was_michael_jackson_a_java">relationship 
      between Jackson Project and late King of Pop</a>. We of course deny all 
      such allegations; or at least can not confirm them. Even if it can be 
      said that Jackson (the JSON processor) IS the King of JSON (0wns the 
      space, so to sp33k!), that's where similarities end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very entertaining. I think this beats the previous silly association; 
      someone commenting he (or she?) liking Jackson because it was named 
      after his cat... :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. If I ever write a YAML parser, I guess I have to name it either 
      &quot;Aaron&quot; or &quot;Presley&quot;...

      Here's something else I did not know: that the iconic Kung Fu hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_lee">Bruce

      ignorant, incompetent boobs... or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually I avoid ranting, at least on my blog entries. Thing is, negative 
      output creates negative image: there is little positive in negativity. 
      If you have nothing good to say, say nothing, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes enough is enough. This is the case with Google, and their 
      pathetic attempts at Creating Java(-like) platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Past failures: Android</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past I have wondered at the clusterfuck known as Android: API is 
      a mess, concoction of JDK pieces included (and mixed with arbitrary open 
      source APIs and implementation classes) is arbitrary and incoherent. But 
      since I don't really work much in the mobile space, I have just shook my 
      head when observing it -- it's not really my problem. Just an eyesore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is relevant in that it set the precedent for what to expect: 
      despite some potentially clever ideas (regarding the lower level 
      machinery), it all seems like a trainwreck, heading nowhere fast. And 
      the only saving grace is that most mobile development platforms are even 
      worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Current problems: start with ignorance</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this marvellous learning experience, you might expect that the big 
      G would learn from its mistakes and get more things right second time 
      around. No such luck: <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google 
      App Engine</a> was a stillbirth; plagued by very similar problem as 
      Android. Most specifically, significant portion of what SHOULD be 
      available (given their implied goal of supporting all JDK5 pieces 
      applicable to the context) was -- and mostly still is -- missing. And 
      decisions again seem arbitrary and inconsistent; but probably made by 
      different bunch of junior developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My specific case in point (or pet peeve) is the lack of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1277">Stax 
      API on GAE</a> (it is missing from white-list, which is needed to load 
      anything within &quot;javax.&quot; packages). It seems clear that this was mostly 
      due to good old ignorance -- they just didn't have enough expertise 
      in-house to cover all necessary aspects of JDK. Hey, that happens: maybe 
      they have no XML expertise within the team; or whoever had some 
      knowledge was busy farting around doing something else. Who knows? 
      Should be easy to fix, whatever gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. From ignorance to excuses</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: omission due to ignorance would be easily solved. Just add 
      &quot;javax.xml.stream&quot; on the white list, and be done with that. After all, 
      what could possibly be problematic with an <i>API package</i>? (we are 
      not talking about bundling an implementation here)
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is where things get downright comical: almost all 
      &quot;explanations&quot; center around the strawman argument of &quot;there must be 
      some security-related issue here&quot;. I may be unfair here -- it is 
      possible that all people peddling this excuse are non-Googlians (if so, 
      my apologies to GAE team). But this is just very ridiculous (dare I say, 
      retarded?) argument, because:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Being but an API package, <b>there is no functionality</b> that could 
        possibly have security implications (yes, l know exactly what is 
        within those few classes -- the only actual code is for implementation 
        discover, which was copied from SAX), and
      </li>
      <li>
        If there are problems with implementations of the API (which should be 
        irrelevant, but humor me here), <b>same problems would affect already 
        included and sanctioned packages</b> (SAX, DOM, JAXP, bundled Xerces 
        implementation of the same)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Perhaps even worse, these &quot;explanations&quot; are served by people who seem 
      to have little idea about package in question. I could as well ask about 
      regular expression or image processing packages it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Misery loves company</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      About the only silver lining here (beyond my not having to work on 
      GAE...) is that there are other packages that got similarly hosed (I 
      think JAXB may be one of those; and many open source libraries are 
      affected indirectly, including popular packages like <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a>). 
      So hopefully there is little bit more pressure in fixing these flaws 
      within GAE.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I so hope that other big companies would consider implementing 
      sand-boxed &quot;cloudy&quot; Java environments. Too bad competitors like 
      Microsoft and <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> tend to focus on 
      other approaches: both doing &quot;their own things&quot;, although those being 
      very different from each other (Microsoft with their proprietary 
      technology; Amazon focusing on offering low-level platform (EC2) and 
      simple services (S3, SQS, SWF -- simple storage, queue, workflow service 
      -- etc), but not managed runtime execution service.

      Ok, here's yet another Internet Phenomenon I had so far missed: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mountain-Three-Wolf-T-Shirt/dp/B000NZW3KC">Three 
      Wolf Moon</a> t-shirt, #1 seller at Amazon Apparel store. Be sure to 
      check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-T-Shirt-Available-Various-Sizes/product-reviews/B000NZW3IY">customer 
      reviews</a> -- they are AWESOME (almost as good as ones <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tuscan-Whole-Milk-Gallon-128/dp/B00032G1S0">Tuscan 
      Whole Milk</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wedding-Chapel-10-Wood-Roof/product-reviews/B000HUQ1C4">Wedding

    </p>
    <p>
      It is kind of cool that this T-shirt has gotten some majic (see its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPB45AUmchM">YouTube 
      mockumercial</a>!) by sheer luck. And its also amazing how useful such 
      viral &quot;marketing&quot; can be (quotes since this had NOTHING to do with 
      manufacturer itself); especially for smaller companies: get 
      Internet-scale sales, even if you are a small player. As long as you get 
      into this strange crowd-a-review cyclone. :-)

      Now the main question is: how many should <b>I</b> order!

			<h3 class="entry-header">Fear and Loathing with Windows Vista</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Ok: so far I have been wondering if there's a reason why Windows Vista 
      has gotten bad rap. I mean, up until now. No wonder any more -- I have 
      tried using Vista for past week or so. And now it is quite clear why 
      people might hate, despite and loathe it. My number one guess: it sucks 
      like no tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean: a simple thing like printing to a network printer is apparently 
      beyond capabilities of this marvel of engineering. At work I tried 
      printing a 2 page document to a network printer. Workflow for this task 
      goes like so:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Ask Vista nicely to locate printers in da hood: it will find 9 out of 
        200+ printers there are, none of which is in the same building; I am 
        not entirely convinced these are not just random names drawn out of 
        some sw engineers a$$. At any rate, none is a real printer within 
        building I work at.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lend Vista a helping hand (first with just one finger raised...): tell 
        it IP name to have a look at.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stare at the popup that claims it has no idea what type of a printer 
        this might be; offering a not-so-helpful list of 79 known printer 
        manufacturers, most with 500+ types of printers
      </li>
      <li>
        Go check the actual type of printer (from its side), write it 
        carefully down
      </li>
      <li>
        Cross-check with list Vista gave you: notice that there is no such 
        printer amongst thousands listed (I wonder if these are even real 
        printers... maybe they were just generated using Jabberwocky)
      </li>
      <li>
        Try using something that is as close to the actual type as possible 
        (same manufacturer, same product line, same number, couple of same 
        letters)
      </li>
      <li>
        Try printing
      </li>
      <li>
        Observe Vista producing to print a stack of paper thicker than your 
        local phone book -- likely because it saw no problem in seding 
        Postscript file to what appears to be a PCL printer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Count your blessing when half-way through printing there is paper jam 
        that prevents some of paper waste
      </li>
      <li>
        Wonder out aloud how is it that previous versions of Windows managed 
        get above (minus printing tons of crap; replaced with printing out the 
        actual doc) done with fewer steps. As does MacOS; and even Linux.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Now, some of you may think I just made above up. I so wish this was the 
      case, but no, it is a sad but true story. And the rest (who heard me 
      curse, and wave that stack of paper angrily, in general direction of my 
      laptop); pardon my french. Yes, that kind of language is not suitable 
      for corporate setting, I know. Next time I will use my mother tongue for 
      expressing my true feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know if there is already a law outlawing manu(factu)re, 
      distribution and selling of Vista. But if not, I sure hope Obama 
      admistration considers it a crime punished by something severe. Like 
      having to use Vista for all your work, for term to exceed 20 years. 
      Without parole.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Another Not-so-well-known Gem: Ant Maven Task</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Ok: I thought it was common knowledge that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Maven repositories are great for storing versions of product artifacts 
        (jars), but
      </li>
      <li>
        Converting projects to Maven is sometimes big hassle, since it 
        requires everything to be set up the Way Maven Wants (which is the key 
        to keeping configuration to minimum, convention-over-configuration)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      and that these two points are somewhat conflicting.<br>So: while it is 
      an absolutely great idea to provide jars of non-Maven projects through 
      Maven repositories, it may be royal PITA to get that done by Mavenizing 
      builds. Or, well, at least extra work that is easily deferred, given 
      half a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fortunately you can both ship your dog food, and staunchly refuse to 
      eat it: just use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/index.html">Ant 
      Maven Task</a> to publish (&quot;deploy&quot;) any Ant-produced (or whatever you 
      use) into Maven repositories (including snapshot repos)! And allow those 
      diligent Maven users (or smarties who use, say, Ivy, but with Maven 
      repos!) to use your great library, without giving in to demands of 
      converting to this new religion. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      So why am I writing this entry? Because it looks like there are still 
      developers who do not know this nifty shortcut! But no more -- you have 
      been advised: get the artifacts out; it's good for you and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. This is quite similar to how you REALLY should also make sure your 
      jars are actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a> 
      bundles. How? By either: (a) using Maven (which has bundle generation 
      targets), or (b) Just Use Ant (JUA), with the nifty -- yes, you guessed 
      it! -- <a href="https://opensource.luminis.net/wiki/display/SITE/OSGi+Bundle+Ant+Task">Ant 
      OSGi Bundle task</a>... :-)<br>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Green Day still Rocks</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p technocode="jkbnexu5cg">
  Last friday I did something I haven't done in a while: go to a 
  rock concert. Turns out it has been way too long -- it was a very 
  positive surprise. Need to be doing this stuff more often. It was also 
  the very first time I've heard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_day">Green 
  Day</a> live, and they did very good job: although I can't compare it to 
  what's their standard, it was probably the best live concert I have ever 
  attended. And perhaps luckily it was not perfect (... how could they 
  leave out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Me_Up_When_September_Ends">my 
  favorite song</a>? all the other hits were included fortunately) -- just 
  very very good -- so there is a small chance of seeing something even 
  better in future. At any rate, well done. I better go buy their last 
  album, so I can give American Idiot little bit of rest.
</p>
<p>
  Also: I think it is quite fitting to do this on July 3rd, to get bit of 
  counter-balance to celebrations of the day following... with somewhat 
  nationalistic (not just &quot;patriotic&quot;) tendencies (luckily, this year 
  things are bit better, maybe due to centrist president, or perhaps due 
  to economy, whatever). Little bit of punky snot rock (with 
  fascism-inspired video wall as background etc) is always good antidote 
  for that stuff. Kind of like how sour works well with sweet, and why 
  Pixar movies mop the floor with Disney (&quot;classic&quot;, not including 
  Pixar...) movies. You need bit of edge to get enjoyable, not just 
  agreeable, tabste. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
  One more thing that I respect about GD guys is their involvement of 
  audience -- they actually let an audience member play rhythm guitar on 
  &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot;. Unless that was staged (kind of doubt that, 
  wouldn't fit well with the image?) it takes some balls to try that out, 
  I think. I can only imagine letting someone from &quot;worst of American Idol 
  auditions&quot; sing: just because someone REALLY wants to sing with their 
  idols doesn't mean they can, or even should.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway: that's that: tomorrow, back to work. And I better blog something 
  about my new gig too: things are off to a good start; I feel excited, 
  think I have a good chance to actually dig deep into domain and get 
  something solved deeply rather than broadly. And best of all, see some 
  of my earlier work having come to fruition, so that I don't even really 
  start from scratch this time.
</p>
<p>
  (and after these personal digressions, I need to get back to factual 
  writing, Jackson 1.2 plans; maintenance work for Woodstox and all the 
  usual content)
