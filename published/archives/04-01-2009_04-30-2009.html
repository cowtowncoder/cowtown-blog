      Toyota Prius was THE car I wanted back in early 2001, when I was buying 
      my first car in the US. It was so cool; and back in the day would have 
      been practical enough as well. With at most 3 people at a time to move 
      around, there's plenty of room, and cargo space was functional for food 
      stuff. But most importantly I cared about environmental aspects back 
      when it wasn't yet fashionable (... in the US, that is), and most people 
      around seemed to want something idiotic like a tacky pickup truck or 
      fugly SUV. Whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, 3+ month waiting list for purchases made it hard to even 
      find one instance to test drive, much less drive out of the lot. In 
      fact, the only thing I achieved when trying to do that was to get 2 hour 
      of high-pressure sales schpiel to get me to by a used Toyota Corolla. 
      Nothing against that dependable vehicle, but that just didn't cut it 
      (eventually I ended up buying a cute fiery red turbo beetle -- but 
      that's a whole another story).
    </p>
    <p>
      But maybe I should consider myself lucky: as detailed in <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/2009-04-22/news/the-flip-side-of-the-perfect-prius/">The 
      Flip Side of the Perfect Prius</a>, Prius owners may be in for more 
      &quot;unexpected adventures&quot; than they bargained for. Specifically, it seems 
      prone to some kind of sudden acceleration syndrome (or, as embarrassing 
      if somewhat less dangerous, &quot;total lock-up&quot; episodes). The case of 
      &quot;Prius in a creek&quot; from Colorado looks particularly creepy. And while I 
      could understand Toyota dealers' attitude for individual incidents (&quot;you 
      floored it instead of braking&quot; / &quot;just ran out of gas&quot;), number of 
      incidents, as well as type of people reporting problems suggests there 
      is something more at work here.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's very unfortunate, for something that in many ways is a harbinger 
      for cleaner tomorrow. I hope the problem, whatever it is, gets resolved.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Educational, and Good Fun Geeky Waste of Time: StackOverflow!</h3>

			<p><p>
      From not-so-news-anymore department: I have grown addicted to another 
      geeky game of sort: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a>&#160;. 
      It's just a simple question/answer site for programmers, but thanks to 
      its game-like scoring system and merit badges it is subversively 
      addictive. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, really, having been 
      addicted to on-line games before: but at this point I should know 
      better. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      On plus side (well, additional plus?), usage can actually be useful and 
      educational too. Beyond trying to increase your karma by answering (and 
      commenting, voting) many answers (and questions too) are actually useful 
      and interesting. After all, there are only that many co-located 
      knowledgable co-workers from whom you can learn. But number of 
      colleagues you can collaborate with in virtual environment is less 
      bounded; and in many ways ranking is more merit-based than the pecking 
      order at your one's place of employment. This makes it easier to 
      consider answers more on merits of themselves than on popularity of the 
      guy who answered it (of course you can be a fanboy too and just look at 
      ranking -- there's Jon Skeet that knows everything -- it's up to you)
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate: if you happen to roam about, I decided to use another Alter 
      Ego there (StaxMan) -- but you can still see the usual cowboy logo, to 
      spot me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to earn my first thousand points 
      and a silver badge!

			<h3 class="entry-header">JSON vs XML: confessions of a JSON advocate</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      First of all: before getting into the issue here, let me just say that 
      this hurts me more than you (not to worry, there's no spanking for 
      anyone) . This because I am about to confess some misgivings I am having 
      with my favorite data format, <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, here I am: a fan of JSON as a data format. The problem is not that I 
      didn't like what JSON is and has. The problem is with things that it has 
      not. And I am almost ashamed to admit it but many of them are found in 
      -- GASP! -- xml. Yes, it is bit sacrilegous to admit this. But it is 
      true: while nothing that is in JSON is bad per se, there are things 
      omitted that should not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here's my brief post-Festivus Airing of Grievances regarding JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Comments are not really optional for a textual data format!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough said. Every textual data format should have a way to embed 
      human-readable unstructured notes, injectable by humans as well as 
      systems transforming or generating content. I often use XML comments to 
      include information about time when a document was generated, or to 
      contain simple debug information. This is very handy, and harmless for 
      automated processing as it can (and should) just ignore such comments. 
      And for actual processing hints there are also XML processing 
      instructions to use, likewise ignorable by processors who don't care 
      about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JSON format almost had its comments, too: an earlier (pre-RFC) version 
      actually did include comments: C and C++ styles I think (i.e. ones that 
      Javascript uses).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why they were removed is beyond me, and is in my opinion the biggest 
      mistake made in specification. Comments just should be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Sometimes redundancy is Useful: case of Elements vs Attributes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (or,<b> &quot;Data is Lonely without Metadata&quot;</b>)
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be confusing to have 2 somewhat overlapping dimensions in XML: 
      that of structured (nested) child elements, and unstructured element 
      attributes. But there is one practical and useful way to separate the 
      two: think of elements and their textual content as actual data, and 
      attributes as metadata (for element data). This simple separation works 
      surprisingly well; and is a useful distinction for use cases like data 
      binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: type of an object can be stored in a type attribute (like, 
      say, &quot;xsi:type&quot;), and field values commonly as child elements. Or store 
      all identifiers as id attributes (like generic &quot;xml:id&quot; as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">Xml:id</a> 
      specification), separate from data contained as elements and textual 
      values stored in elements. But useful for adding references to the 
      element sub-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      JSON has no such facility, so any metadata has to be either in-line 
      mixed with data, or structured as siblings. Initially this may not seem 
      like a big deal, but it gets confusing pretty quickly in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why doesn't this matter with actual (Java) Objects? Isn't JSON more 
      &quot;object oriented&quot;, being an object notation, not markup language? Well, 
      ava Objects DO have metadata that is orthogonal to data (object state, 
      i.e. its member fields)! What else is class information than metadata, 
      separate from actual data? All that typing -- both class declarations, 
      and runtime Object types -- is metadata, not data; similarly for all 
      method information. And most obviouly the latest additional to class 
      metadata, Java annotations, is pure orthogonal metadata. It is not a 
      perfect analogy (class info is per-class, like static memebers and 
      methods; whereas actual data is per-instance), but indicates the need of 
      place for both data and metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. As Simple as Possible, but No Simpler</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although both of above paragraphs could be repeated here -- as in JSON 
      being simplified beyond reasonable, by omitting comments -- there is 
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: unquoted linefeeds are not allowed within JSON String 
      values; linefeeds must be quoted just like other control characters. 
      This is Bad. Why are they not allowed to be included as is, given how 
      common they are in text? I suspect it was done in effort to make it 
      easier to &quot;parse&quot; JSON, by allowing single-line regexps to work. But I 
      don't care -- if I parse something, I do it properly. Regexps alone do 
      not parse make (they make lexer, useful and used by parsers, but not 
      parsers). Linefeeds are displayable characters just like anything else. 
      It's quite ok to let them be used within String values: after all, they 
      are often needed there. So why force quoting them, even though they are 
      not used as separators?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also things that I think are good or at least acceptable 
      riddances: for example, while it is often useful to have choice of 
      quotes in xml (single or double quotes), I'm not crying after loss of 
      apostrophes. I could write a parser that handles multiple kinds of 
      String value markers; but I can also generate content using just one 
      kind. But it does complicate hand-writing and modifying content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Is Ordering really irrelevant?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In XML content order is mostly significant; the only exception being 
      attributes that are unordered. This makes some parts of data binding 
      more challenging, because objects usually have no concept of ordering 
      for properties. Because of this there are many legal easily definable 
      XML structures that can not be easily be mapped to (Java) objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while sometimes problematic, ordering can also be valuable. For 
      example, it is great that it is possible to guarantee that certain 
      elements (like, say, &quot;header&quot;) comes before others (like, say, 
      &quot;footer&quot;). The only conceptually correct way to do this in JSON is to 
      use Lists (aka Arrays). But their values are anonymous, unlike those of 
      Maps. Alternatively it is possible for JSON processors to preserve 
      actual physical ordering; but the problem is that not all processors 
      will do this; not the least because specification discourages this.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the most obviously useful ordering is that the metadata (attributes) 
      always precedes data (elements). That is something you can count on; and 
      for common types of metadata (those class types and identifiers, see 
      above), this is pretty optimal arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Other problems?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing of interest regarding list above is that none of them is a 
      commonly stated reason by those who advocating using XML over JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, I think that most commonly used reasons are very poor 
      excuses of arguments; usually based on fundamental misunderstanding of 
      actual benefits of XML, or good use cases for either XML or JSON. 
      Perhaps I should collect list of such claims to shoot them down next. :-)
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">On Versioning (RESTish) Web Service APIs</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One perennial thing that crops up like crocuses around March, is the 
      question of the Right Ways To Version RESTish Web Services.<br>There are 
      multiple good, unbounded number of bad, and plenty of ugly ways too. But 
      the Good ones are mostly just pragmatic guidelines; there is no science 
      behind most of it. Some bad ones are polished, but the real snake oil 
      comes with the ugly ones. But I digress. Since good ones tend to be 
      somewhat boring, there's bit less discussion on those.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is great to find that there are others whose those align nicely 
      with yours, especially ones that document their thinking. It not only 
      lends credence to your ideas, but makes it easier to express them in 
      form of &quot;have a look at here&quot;, sort of as baseline for discussion. In 
      this case there's this in-process document called &quot;<a href="http://www.jbarnette.com/2009/04/07/http-apis.html" title="Versioning HTTP APIs">Versioning 
      HTTP APIs</a>&quot; that quite nicely serves this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: I thought the article is worth reading; and I agree with at 
      least 90+% rate. Which is pretty good, about the rate of agreement with 
      my own writings after a year or so. :-)

      I have grown to be a big fan of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">JAX-RS</a> 
      (&quot;Java API for RESTful Web Services&quot; -- but where did &quot;X&quot; come from?),

      Although I have only been actual user for past couple of months (and 
      lurker on the mailing lists for less than a year), I am fully sold on it 
      by now. In many ways, it might be the only web services framework you 
      need to known, on J2EE platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think of it as moving from manual to automatic shifting. Very 
      convenient, lettig me forget about clutch and gears, and just focus on 
      the road and traffic ahead. Or perhaps Hanoi Rocks playing on CD.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what exactly is it that JAX-RS and Jersey provide? Here is small 
      sampling of what I like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Jersey the Plumber</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the gunk between the server receiving a request, and that 
      request reaching actual business logic layer? With Jersey, you only need 
      to be vaguely aware that it exists, give it a hint as to how you want 
      the endpoints to match, and it Does The Plumbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You create end points by annotating your method to take in @GET or @POST 
      (etc) requests. And kindly request that things like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        URL path components (@PathParam
      </li>
      <li>
        Query (@QueryParam) and Form (@FormParam) parameters
      </li>
      <li>
        HTTP headers (@HeaderParam
      </li>
      <li>
        Cookie values (@CookieParam
      </li>
      <li>
        POST payload (any parameter without other annotations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      are brought to your method as parameters so annotated. And that's what 
      they will be when method gets called, when request matches the path 
      definition. Pretty nifty. And similarly response is converted back to 
      actual serialized response message, along with headers (for content 
      type) and status code. This means that dealing with the interface (GIGO) 
      takes one method with perhaps 6 lines of code; or maybe 10 if you do 
      proper exception handling to deal with breakage of your business logic.
    </div>
    <p>
      So long for having to know what kind of stinky stuff clogs the drains: 
      feel free to focus on the actual business logic within service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this convenience alone is worth the framework. Seriously. It 
      makes writing services almost fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Needles and Pins</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as important as getting the input parameters in (and reponse out) 
      is to get hold of context objects, to access configuration and shared 
      contextual facilities like connection pools and caches . And this too is 
      provided to you by simple act of annotation: in this case by annotating 
      members of your resource classes (any class with JAX-RS annotations to 
      the class or at least one of its methods is a resource).
    </p>
    <p>
      Need some Servlet Context with your service? Just declare a member 
      variable is desired type, add @Context annotation, and it'll be there 
      when you need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Any Way You Want It -- Single Format is SO passe...</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that Last Fashionable web service framework? What was it.... 
      something named by a commone household detergent? The one that allowed 
      you to use any data format, as long as it was based on pointy brackets? 
      (if not, good for you).
    </p>
    <p>
      Well: nowadays SoapSponge Squarepants may act like it was hip Json the 
      Menace: but the only way to do this is to fake Json (aka <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/03/entry_229.html">FrankenJSON</a>). 
      And usually that's as far as &quot;cross-format&quot; tolerance goes. And this 
      despite not having &quot;xml&quot; anywhere within acronym itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so with JAX-RS: any format can be used. And while XML still is sort 
      of &quot;First among equals&quot; (due to bit of preferential treatment that 
      implementations like Jersey give to JAXB), it is barely noticeable and 
      does not get in the way. In fact my simple built-in-a-day-or-two SQL 
      report service can provide results as XML, JSON, HTML or CSV; and if I 
      need to, in PDF and some more of alphabet soup too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Addendum: Word of Warning</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything I don't like with JAX-RS or Jersey?
    </p>
    <p>
      No big regrets yet: but there is one thing I have noticed that can get 
      you to a rat hole: excessive abstraction and indirection. There are many 
      hooks to further create factories, providers and injectors that 
      sometimes application developers are turned into framework developers. 
      It is good to keep simple things simple, and only add indirection when 
      it actually makes sense. There is always time to create frameworks later 
      on, once you learn good ways to build clean and working code.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having ways to build abstract extensions is not really fault of the 
      framework I guess: and most of the things exposed are made good use of 
      itself.
    </p></p>

			<p><p>
      I admit it: I am generally a late adopter of new things. It has its 
      benefits -- I have missed countless train wrecks by waiting for others 
      to figure out god awful messes hidden in well-intended APIs, libraries, 
      patterns, styles and wherever such dangers lurk. But downside is also 
      obvious -- I could have been more productive had a found gems in cases 
      where they hadn't been hidden for months or years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the case with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jquery">jQuery</a>. 
      What a pleasant awe-inspiring library: compact, powerful, intuitive and 
      straight-forward to use. I suspect there's no point in elaborating more 
      as to why I like it -- most everything has already been said. Just 
      google for testimonials.<br>All I can say is that I wish I had dug in 
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      But better late than never.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on a related note another obvious observation (&quot;Hey, this is Captain 
      Obvious calling... &quot;) is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jax-rs">JAX-RS</a> 
      (Jersey) and jQuery go together very nicely; especially when using 
      Jackson-based JSON binding.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Improving XSLT performance with Woodstox/SAX , part2: now with Xalan</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Ok, so we now know that Woodstox can pimp Saxon-based XSLT processing by 
      up to 30%. But how about <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j">Xalan</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are results running same stylesheets over 3 parsers (Xerces, 
      Woodstox, Aalto):

      <img src="/perf/xsl-results-xalan-2009-04-03/result.jpg">

    <p>
      And here are the <a href="/perf/xsl-results-xalan-2009-04-03/">complete 
      results</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, we can expect some incremental speed improvements (like 
      20-30% more data processed within given resources) with Woodstox, and 
      tad more with Aalto. Another cheap way to improve your CPU economy. 
      Consider it a Green Idea of the day or something.

			<h3 class="entry-header">Improving XSLT performance with Woodstox/SAX (or Aalto): 20-30% more thorughput!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      One thing I mentioned <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/03/entry_215.html">earlier</a> 
      regarding potential use cases for Woodstox' SAX API implementation was 
      to speed up XSLT processing. 2 main Java XSLT processor contestants -- <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan</a> 
      and <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a> -- both use SAX as 
      their primary input source. Since Woodstox is a tad faster for both 
      reading and writing XML than its leading open source competitors 
      (including one JDK bundles, <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/">Xerces</a>), 
      one would expect some speed boost for using Woodstox as the SAX parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      To test out this hypothesis, I wrote some more StaxBind code (which 
      currently lives within Woodstox svn repository at Codehaus) to allow 
      running set of XSLT stylesheets over documents: in this case test cases 
      of <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/r/800">XSLTMark</a> test suite.<br>For 
      additonal fun, I also included tests using <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/hatchery/aalto/index.html">Aalto</a> 
      given it also implements SAX and is complete enough to handle XSLT 
      transformations just fine. For the first test run, I chose Saxon; I will 
      later do the same with Xalan.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      So here's a quick look at combined results over couple dozen tests:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="/perf/xsl-results-saxon-2009-04-02/result.jpg">
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, check out <a href="/perf/xsl-results-saxon-2009-04-02/">complete 
      results</a> for full overview.
    </p>
    <p>
      The executive summary is that using Woodstox can give you 20-30% more 
      throughput for these test cases; and consistently at least some speed 
      up. Aalto can give another slight boost as well. And given how simple it 
      all is (see <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/03/entry_215.html">here</a> 
      for a reminder), it should be a nice easy win.
    </p>
    <p>
      What next? Well, in addition to testing Xalan, it would also be nice to 
      get a more representative set of real-world stylesheets. But for now, 
      I'll assume these results are representative.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">A Modest Proposal for Rewriting Woodstox, Jackson, using Protocol Buffers</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (<b>Update, April 2nd</b>: Never mind: changed my mind -- revert back to 
      the old course!)
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      After playing some more with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Google 
      Protocol Buffer</a> implementation, I have become more and more 
      impressed by it. It is easy to love its debuggability, expressiveness 
      and extensive tool support. But most of all it is the performance 
      aspects that have caught my attention. Those propeller heads at the big 
      G have certainly gotten performance boosted to Infinity and Beyond 
      (almost to 11, dare I say).
    </p>
    <p>
      Given its superior performance, I figured it is pointless to continue 
      working on direct approaches to parsing JSON and XML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, my new plan -- effective immediately! -- is to retool Woodstox 
      (XML) and Jackson (JSON) parsers to make use of some PB goodness. Here 
      is how I think it can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. For main parsing and generator, use Protocol Buffers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The core reading and writing of content should be done using Protobuf; 
      and consequently all content needs to be in compact ProtoBuf binary data 
      format.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this is the obvious right way to go, it does add some problems 
      because existing legacy applications will expect &quot;native&quot; APIs to 
      process content. And on the other hand, legacy content will still be 
      using textual data formats in question.<br>So to make things work, there 
      is need for just wee bit of &quot;glue&quot; both above and below ProtoBuf layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Below ProtoBuf, use Simple Light-weight converters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For XML, the natural light-weight translation mechanism from textual XML 
      into PB format is XSLT, possibly augmented with XSLT 2.0 type 
      information, derived from dynamically generated Schema Types. If 
      necessary (for example, if performance is not as good as expected), 
      these can be converted to binary XML during runtime (and possibly 
      re-parsed using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_XML_Interchange">EXI 
      Binary XML</a>): this to minimize amount of processing done using 
      inefficient textual format. And if nothing else works, it is always 
      possible to add more layers to improve efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      For JSON choices are more limited, but I am confident that some 
      combination of JsonPath and YAML should do the trick. Another 
      possibility would be to use something like BadgerFish mapping convention 
      (for binary data, I am thinking of defining straight-forward 
      complementary mapping, code named &quot;StinkySock&quot;, but more on that later 
      on).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Above ProtoBuf use Some More Converters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above PB, some limited amount of glue is also needed, to produce kinds 
      of events current crop of applications need (Stax, Jackson API). The 
      simplest mapping for XML seems to be using SAX API first (since that is 
      easy to expose). But as Stax sources can not use SAX (push vs pull), it 
      will be necessary to use intermediate structure: DOM seems just like the 
      simple thing to use. And since DOM can be read via DOMSource, it is easy 
      to produce Stax events from there (Woodstox can actually already do 
      that, which makes it totally trivial).
    </p>
    <p>
      I will leave the details of converting from Protocol Buffer tokens into 
      JSON for interested readers -- suffice it to say that it should be 
      possible to concoct similarly simple and elegant solution as outlined 
      above, without undue effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Want to know more?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there are still some details open, there is much more to 
      discuss -- instead of boring you here, feel free to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_fools">read 
      more on my plans</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, please let me know what you think -- I am very excited about 
      this new approach!
    </p></p>
