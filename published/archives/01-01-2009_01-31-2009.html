      Ok, this may be news to some of you. To be honest, it was bit of news to 
      me too. But it must be true, I found it from Wikipedia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently &quot;Tatu&quot; was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatu_(disambiguation)">codename 
      of mr Che Guevara</a> during his stint in Congo, before embarking on the 
      faithful mission in south America. Wow. I had no idea that he was a fan 
      of mine! It is somewhat less surprising that my namesake is a 
      world-renowned &quot;Kinbaku performer&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, oh yes, there is also a Russian pop band that took my name too 
      (why couldn't they just name themselves like, I don't know, &quot;Pop tarts&quot; 
      or something? -- ba-da-boom, thank you thank you, I'll be here the whole 
      week! Tip the cows or something!).

      From February issue of Scientific American (yes, they must have a time 
      machine to send this issue from the future), here's another interesting 
      environmental factoid: red meat produces biggie size environmental 
      problems in addition to clogging your arteries:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=D62A22C8-3048-8A5E-10E81DEE49138B4C">The 
      Greenhouse Hamburger</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      (I so wish there was a way to deep-link into the article, but I guess 
      that's reserved for subscibers; or maybe I just haven't yet found the 
      right click path?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Or rather, what is surprising is the scale of the thing: I was well 
      aware of methane production part of bovine-based agriculture, which does 
      contribute significant punch to the greenhouse effect, along with rice 
      paddies (cows also contribute urban legend pearls such as &quot;Cows produce 
      enough methane to fill a zeppelin each day [or week?]&quot; (patently 
      untrue!) but I digress).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not know that there are estimates that put beef production (or 
      is the whole food production chain? article is ambiguous in this point) 
      at 14 - 22% of TOTAL greenhouse generation, ranking alongside with 
      transportation and industry. Another way to put things into perspective 
      is to consider that pound-by-pound cow meat produces 13x as much green 
      house impact as chicken meat; and the ratio to &quot;Idaho beef&quot; (aka spud) 
      is 57x.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like one good reason to develop further my latest 
      gastrological masterpiece, &quot;Spamofy Half-and-Half pasta&quot;. Try it, it 
      actually is pretty good: pasta sauce where protein comes evenly split 
      between Spam and Tofu. Not only healthier for you &amp; planet, but also 
      tasty, and less salty (sodium's dangers are vastly exaggerated, but it 
      does cause bloating if nothing else). :-)<br>
    </p></p>

      Ok, let's have a look at one &quot;Linux and Java run circles around .Net&quot; 
      phenomenon sighting:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://technotes.blogs.sapo.pt/1391.html">http://technotes.blogs.sapo.pt/1391.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks like combination of Linux, Mina (or Grizzly), <a href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/">JibX</a>, 
      and our favorite &quot;new kid on the block&quot; lighting fast xml parser, <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/hatchery/aalto/index.html">Aalto</a> 
      can haul some serious xml data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would of course be nice to know how much of this throughput can be 
      attributed to Aalto. My bet is, &quot;quite a lot&quot;, but I might not be quite 
      objective enough here. At any rate, cool results, I hope these can be 
      verified by others!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is actually second sighting of Aalto being used for something; the 
      first one was also a benchmark. Not quite production use yet (and I 
      wouldn't quite recommend production use quite yet, not before 1.0 
      release), but some serious evaluation at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. while Aalto may be faster, <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a> 
      is still the King of Open Source Java Xml parsing, and can also pack a 
      punch when there's <a href="http://technotes.blogs.sapo.pt/564.html">Need 
      for Speed</a>.

      Something I used to do occasionally, back in the day, was to track what 
      I had been up to lately. Being a lazy bum, I did this using Google as a 
      free tracking device. A lazy guy's method of doing this is to google 
      with one's name as the search phrase, and see what surfaces. This 
      obviously only works for those of us with funny or weird names (sorry 
      Paul, you are so out of luck!)<br>This way you will see a glimpse of 
      your whereabouts as seen by the online world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not been doing this for a while (a year or two?) now. Not only is 
      it tacky, just an electronical means of navel gazing, but worse, I 
      wasn't apparently doing a whole lot based on results. Or maybe it's just 
      that Google wasn't paying attention (ha!). It was like watching paint 
      dry, or perhaps grass grow. Or my running out of analogies to use. Top 
      hits returned were too often ones pointing to my even-then-obsolete old 
      home page (at my <a href="http://www.hut.fi">Alma Mater</a> that I had 
      left years prior), that were &quot;still in progress&quot;; as well as links to 
      mailing lists of dead projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But over the weekend I decided to do one more peek via Google-o-matic, 
      to get a retrospective of the Year 2008 by and according to Tatu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo and behold! Things had changed since the last check (whenever it 
      was). No more stale entries within top pages (bye bye Niksula home 
      page!) -- whether that's due to Google getting better, or <a href="http://www.hut.fi">Helsinki 
      University of Technology</a> finally reclaiming wasted disk space. Fewer 
      high-ranking links to mailing lists from late 90s. Life is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beyond this, there were all kinds of interesting (... to me, 
      anyways) as-of-yet-unknown-to-me tidbits that I can now start dropping 
      in casual conversations (and especially non-casual ones!). Plus some 
      other factoids I had briefly seen and promptly forgotten about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of least unnoteworthy nuggets I ended up with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Once upon a time, I contributed a minor patch to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> 
        (query parser refactoring). Ditto for <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a>, 
        <a href="http://jdbm.sourceforge.net/">JDBM</a>, <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a> 
        and <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a>. Neat things is 
        that these are all cool projects; with maybe exception of Kaffe that 
        is (or, used to be? hey, is it alive again?) a dead if neat project.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was (am?) considered an <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/team.html">ActiveMQ 
        contributor</a> (I am flattered by this, but not quite sure what'd I 
        do -- maybe they use Woodstox? -- thanks anyway James!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Rock star references: while I am not yet considered a Rock Star 
        Programmer (is there a Hall of Fame for coders? haven't gotten a call 
        so far! And does one have to be dead to get inducted there? hope 
        not?), I have racked up multiple (as in, two!) quotes from certified 
        RSPs: thank you Dan and Kohsuke, you do Rock! (I suddenly feel &quot;Almost 
        Famous&quot; -- kind of like those bands who no one ever listened to, 
        expect few guys from bands like The Beatles and Rolling Stones -- but 
        in a way it's much better as I have a nice job, don't starve to death 
        or overdose on drugs, so I shouldn't really whine)
      </li>
      <li>
        I am a lucky <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/jitu/archive/2008/10/metro_gap_winne.html">GAP 
        winner</a> (ok ok, I already blogged about this one earlier)
      </li>
      <li>
        I am referenced by 2 actual physical books, sold by Amazon; &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Rock-Star-Programmers-Riding/dp/0071490833/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233035968&sr=1-2">Secrets 
        of the Rock Star programmers</a>&quot; (see reference 2 bullets up), and &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-XML-Programmer-Bill-Evjen/dp/0471777773/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233035968&sr=1-1">Professional 
        XML (Programmer to Programmer)</a>&quot; (this wrt Woodstox). These could 
        come in handy during job interviews: like Jason Hunter likes to say, 
        there's no better answer to question &quot;what have you been up to&quot; than a 
        gesture pointing to a book on manager's book shelf and asking him/her 
        to compare author name with candidate name. Well, I'll accept lesser 
        fame of being mentioned by an author as the consolation price. Maybe 
        &quot;let's search Amazon to see where my name pops up&quot; could come in handy 
        one of these days.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is of course lots of other miscellaneous business-as-usual stuff 
      out there:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        links to Open Source projects than I'm most involved with (<a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org">Woodstox</a>, 
        <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson</a>, <a href="http://staxmate.codehaus.org">StaxMate</a>, 
        <a href="http://jug.safehaus.org">Java UUID Generator</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        a reference or two <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.4185">my 
        Master's Thesis</a> (in publication archives, I don't think any actual 
        publication refers to it, very low impact factor... I never was much 
        of an academic! :-)
      </li>
      <li>
        links to mailing lists archives n+1 other open source projects and 
        such.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I also have to say I am quite impressed by what Google can gather, and 
      especially what it can weed out as duplicate entries. I only had to 
      waste half an hour of my life to gather the list above. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, it does appear like year 2008 was an eventful for me after 
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      May we live in interesting times during 2009 as well!
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Eco^2 (Economy + Ecology) Rulez Ok?</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Let's start with the money shot: here's the link that effected me to 
      write this particular entry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=sb_success.sb_successstories2008_johnsonbraund">http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=sb_success.sb_successstories2008_johnsonbraund</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason I really like things like this is that they combine two 
      important but often conflicting aspects: economy of the project, and 
      ecological impact of the project. This is just one random link, but one 
      can't read a respectable magazine like, say, Fortune, without spotting 
      one or two each time. That's awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a closet environmentalist for years, specifically after 
      moving from the western Europe to US in late 90s. That is rather 
      typical: most people who have grown up in a lutheran, reason- and 
      reasonability-loving (&quot;everything in moderation&quot;) society should feel 
      similar nausea over this macabre era of McMansions and big fugly cars 
      (SUVs)
    </p>
    <p>
      But lately -- as in past two years or so -- there has been remarkably 
      change in the air... wind of change, to use a cliche. From around the 
      time of release of that <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inconvenient_truth/">&quot;Al 
      Gore movie&quot;</a>, things have finally started moving in the right 
      direction here on the left side of the Pond. Finally! I truly believe 
      that Churchill was right with his witty and insightful quote: &quot;<b>The 
      Americans will always do the right thing . . . After they've exhausted 
      all the alternatives</b>&quot;. That was within context of WW2, but it 
      applies equally well to US handling of the global warming, or more 
      generally to pollution as a global problem. And while some see this 
      comment as pessimistic (&quot;do these blubbering idiots always have to try 
      every wrong approach first?&quot;), I view it as optimistic. After all, not 
      everyone does the right in the end, no matter what. Plus, americans as a 
      nation tend to follow through; or at least have with the major 
      undertakings such as, well, world wars. And then, as now, the strongest 
      engine around these parts is the industro-economic one. Let's hope the 
      big wheel will start turning for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the only major remaining obstacle now is the excuse-inducing &quot;we 
      must get all countries to agree to act on this&quot; attitude -- screw that, 
      let's get to work! The rest can follow us, and we can follow, say, 
      Germany, Denmark and Spain.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Json processing with Jackson: Method #3/3: Tree Traversal</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      <b>Update, 06-Mar-2009: Alas, code example will not work with Jackson 
      0.9.9 or above due to API changes; check out javadocs for replacements 
      until I get a chance to rewrite the example</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (for background, refer to the earlier <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_131.html">&quot;Three 
      Ways to Process Json&quot;</a> entry)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have both the low-level (event streams) and high-level (data 
      binding) approaches covered, let's consider the third and last 
      alternative: that of using a tree model for traversing over Json content.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is the Tree Model that is traversed? It is a tree built from 
      Json content. Tree consists of parent-chuld linked nodes that represent 
      Json constructs such as Arrays (&quot;[ ... ]&quot;), Objects (&quot;{ ... }&quot;) and 
      values (true, false, Strings, numbers, nulls). This is similar to xml 
      DOM, as DOM is the &quot;standard&quot; tree model for xml, and there are many 
      alternative tree models (such JDom, Dom4j, XOM) available as well.<br>This 
      tree can then be traversed, data within accessed, possibly modified and 
      written back out as Json.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before discussing the approach in more detail, let's have a look at some 
      sample code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Sample Usage</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it is difficult to demonstrate actual benefits of the approach 
      with simple structures (like the Twitter search entry shown earlier), 
      let's consider something more complicated. Following made-up example of 
      a collection of customer records will have to do:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>[
 {
  &quot;name&quot; : {
    &quot;first : &quot;Mortimer&quot;,
    &quot;middleInitial : &quot;m&quot;,
    &quot;last&quot; : &quot;Moneybags&quot; 
  },
  &quot;address&quot; : {
    &quot;street&quot; : &quot;1729 Opulent Street&quot;,
    &quot;zipcode&quot; : 98040,
    &quot;state&quot; : &quot;WA&quot;
  },
  &quot;contactMethods&quot; : [
    { &quot;type&quot; : &quot;phone/home&quot;, &quot;ref&quot; : &quot;206-232-1234&quot; },
    { &quot;type&quot; : &quot;phone/work&quot;, &quot;ref&quot; : &quot;303-123-4567&quot; }
  ]
 }
// (rest of entries omitted to save space)
]</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      Let us consider a case where we want to go through all customer entries, 
      and extract some data out of each. Additionally we will add an &quot;email&quot; 
      contact method for each entry, assuming none exist before changes (to 
      simplify code).
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>TreeMapper mapper = new TreeMapper();
JsonNode root = mapper.readTree(new File(&quot;customers.json&quot;));
// we'll get a &quot;org.codehaus.jackson.map.node.ArrayNode&quot; instance for json array, but no need for casts
for (JsonNode customerNode : root) {
  // we know &quot;first&quot; always exists if &quot;name&quot; exists, and is a TextNode (if not, could use 'getValueAsText')
  // (note: could use 'getElementValue' instead of 'getPath', but it's good practice to use getPath())
  String firstName = customerNode.getPath(&quot;name&quot;).getFieldValue(&quot;first&quot;).getTextValue();
  // has an address? (could also just use 'getPath()' which returns 'missing' node)
  int zip = -1;
  if (customerNode.getFieldValue(&quot;address&quot;) != null) {
    zip = customerNode.getFieldValue(&quot;address&quot;).getFieldValue(&quot;zipcode&quot;).getIntValue();
  }
  // either way, let's add email contact (that is assumed to be missing)
  ObjectNode email = mapper.objectNode();
  email.setElement(&quot;type&quot;, mapper.textNode(&quot;email&quot;));
  email.setElement(&quot;ref&quot;, mapper.textNode(firstName+&quot;_&quot;+zip+&quot;@foobar.com&quot;));
  customerNode.getPath(&quot;address&quot;).appendElement(email);
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      So here we have something to give an idea of what tree traversal code 
      may look like. Let's go back to conceptual musing for a while, before 
      returning to practical concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Differences between Tree Model and Data Binding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At first this approach may appear quite similar to data binding: after 
      all, a bunch of interconnected objects is created from Json to be 
      traversed, access, modified and possibly written out as Json again. But 
      whereas data binding <b>converts</b> Json into Java objects (and vice 
      versa), Tree model <b>represents</b> Json content. Tree models are a 
      true native representation of Json content itself and somewhat removed 
      from &quot;real&quot; Java objects: their only purpose is to allow more convenient 
      access to Json than event streams. There is no business functionality 
      involved with the generic node objects. Also, types available are 
      limited to ones that Json natively supports. One important benefit is 
      that there is simple, efficient and reliable one-to-one mapping between 
      the tree model and Json, which means that there is no loss of 
      information when reading Json into the tree model or writing tree model 
      out as Json; and that such transformation is always possible. This is 
      different from data binding where some conversions may not be possible, 
      or need extra configuration and coding to occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than regular java objects (that data binding operates on), the 
      tree model here is quite similar to the &quot;Poor Man's Object&quot;, plain old 
      HashMap. HashMaps are often used by developers when they don't think 
      they need a &quot;real&quot; object (or don't want to define Yet Another Class 
      etc). Same benefits and challenges apply to tree models as to using 
      HashMaps as flexible and sometimes convenient alternatives to specific 
      Java classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Benefits</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given above description of what tree model is, what could be reasons to 
      use them over data binding? Here are some common reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since we do not need specific Java objects to bind to, there may less 
        code to write. Although access may not be as convenient, for simple 
        tasks (especially for &quot;throw-away&quot; code) it is nice not to have to 
        implement boring bean setter/getter code.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the structure of Json content is highly irregular, it may be 
        difficult (or impossible) to find or create equivalent Java object 
        structure. Tree model may be the only practical choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        For displaying any Json content (for, say, Json editor) no typing is 
        generally available: but it is quite easy to render a tree. Tree model 
        is a natural choice for internal access and manipulation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One analogy is that of contrasting dynamic scripting languages (like 
      Ruby, Python or Javascript) and statically typed languages such as Java: 
      Tree Model would be similar to scripting languages, whereas data binding 
      would be similar to Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Drawbacks</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also drawbacks, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since access is mostly untyped, many problems that would be found with 
        typed alternative (data binding) may go unnoticed during development
      </li>
      <li>
        Memory usage is proportional to content mapped (similar to data 
        binding), so tree models can not be used with huge Json content, 
        unless mapping is done chunk at a time. This is the same problem that 
        data binding encounters; and sometimes the solution is to use 
        Stream-of-Events instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        For some uses, additional memory usage and processing overhead is 
        unnecesary: specifically, when only generating (writing) Json, there 
        is often no need to build an in-memory tree (or objects with data 
        binding) if only Json output is needed. Instead, Stream-of-Events 
        approach is the best choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using Tree Model often leads to either procedural 
        (non-object-oriented) code, or having to wrap pieces of Tree Model in 
        specific Java classes; at which point more code gets written for 
        little gain (compared to regular objects used with data binding)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In general it is good to be clear on why tree model is used over other 
      alternatives: experience with xml processing often leads developers to 
      be too eager to use tree-based processing for all tasks, even when it is 
      not the best choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Future Plans</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Jackson API is still evolving, there are many things within 
      TreeMapper and JsonNode APIs that could and will be improved. More 
      convenience methods will be added to simplify construction of new nodes, 
      and to support common access patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      One specifically promising un-implemented idea is that of defining a 
      Path or Query language (think of XPath and XQuery). There is a good 
      chance that something like this gets implemented. There have been 
      proposals (such as <a href="http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/">JsonPath</a>;); 
      these may form the basis of access language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6. Next?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After reviewing the 3 canonical approaches, it is time to suggest 
      guidelines for choosing between them.<br>Stay tuned!

			<p><p>
      (for background, refer to the earlier <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_131.html">&quot;Three 
      Ways to Process Json&quot;</a> entry)
    </p>
    <p>
      After reviewing the first &quot;canonical&quot; Json processing method 
      (reading/writing Stream of Events), let's go up the abstraction level, 
      and consider the second approach: that of binding (aka mapping) data 
      between Java Objects and Json content. That is, given Json content in 
      some form (like, say, Stream-of-Events...), library can construct 
      equivalent Java objects; and conversely it can write Json content given 
      Java objects. And do this without explicit instructions for low-level 
      read/write operations (such as code from the preceding blog entry). This 
      is often the most &quot;natural&quot; approach to Java programmers, since it is 
      Object-centric. Approach is often referred to as &quot;code-first&quot; in related 
      contexts, such as when discussing methods to process xml content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson's Data Binding support comes through a single mapper object, <b>org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper</b>. 
      It can be used to read Json content and construct Java object(s); or 
      conversely write Json content that describes given Object. The design is 
      quite similar to what <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a>, 
      or <a href="http://jaxb.dev.java.net">JAXB</a> do with xml. The main 
      differences (beyond data format used) are conceptual -- XStream focuses 
      on Object serialization, Jackson on data binding; and JAXB2 supports 
      both &quot;schema-first&quot; and &quot;code-first&quot; (and maybe emphasizes former more) 
      whereas Jackson does not use schemas of any kind. But similarities are 
      still more striking that differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the background: let's have a look at how things work, by 
      using Data Binding interface to do same work as was done in the first 
      entry using Stream-of-Events abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Reading Objects from Json</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok. Given that our first example needed about two dozens lines of code, 
      how much code might we need here? It should be less, to support the 
      claim of being more convenient. How about:
    </p>
    <pre>  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  TwitterEntry entry = mapper.readValue(new File(&quot;input.json&quot;));</pre>
    <p>
      ... two? I guess you could make a one-liner too; or, if you want to 
      separate pieces out more, half a dozen. But definitely much less than 
      the manual approach. And the difference only grows when considering more 
      complex objects and object graphs: whereas manual serialization needs 
      more and more code, data binding code may not grow at all. Sometimes you 
      may need to configure mapper more to deal with edge cases, or add 
      annotations to support non-standard naming; but even then it is just a 
      fraction of code to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some more examples, just to show how to do simple things:
    </p>
    <pre>  Boolean yesOrNo = mapper.readValue(&quot;true&quot;); // returns Boolean.TRUE<br>
  int[] ids = mapper.readValue(&quot;1, 3, 98&quot;); // new int[] { 1, 3, 98 }
<br>  Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt; dictionary = mapper.readValue( &quot;{ \&quot;word\&quot; : [ \&quot;synonym1\&quot;, \&quot;synonym2\&quot; ] }&quot;,
new TypeReference&lt;Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;() { }); // trickier, due to Type Erasure
<br>  Object misc = mapper.readValue(&quot;[ 1, true, null ]&quot;, Object.class);
  // above will return a List with Integer(1), Boolean.TRUE and null as its elements
<br>  // and here's something different: instead of TwitterEntry, let's claim content is a Map!
  Map&lt;String,Object&gt; entryAsMap = mapper.readValue(new File(&quot;input.json&quot;),
new TypeReference&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;&gt;() {} ); // works!
<br>  Map&lt;String,Object&gt; entryAsMap = (Map&lt;String,Object&gt;)mapper.readValue(new File(&quot;input.json&quot;), Object.class);
// as does this</pre>
    <p>
      Of these, only last two example may seem surprising: didn't we actually 
      serialize a bean... so how can it become a Map? Because there is no such 
      thing as type (java class) in Json content: ObjectMapper does its best 
      to map Json content to specific Java type, and in general, Objects can 
      be viewed as sort of &quot;static Maps&quot;. Hence it is perfectly fine to &quot;Map 
      to Map&quot; here. And finally, ObjectMapper also has sort of special 
      handling for base type &quot;Object.class&quot;: it signals that mapper is to use 
      whatever Objects are best matches to Json content in question. For 
      Strings this means Strings, for booleans java.lang.Boolean, for Json 
      arrays java.util.List and for Json object structures java.util.Map. In 
      this case it works similar to how explicitly specifying result to be of 
      type Map works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Writing Objects as Json</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given how simple it was to read Java objects from Json, how hard can it 
      be to write them?<br>Not very:
    </p>
    <pre>  mapper.writeValue(new File(&quot;result.json&quot;), entry);</pre>
    <p>
      In fact, I claim it is pathetically easy. So much for job security!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Where's the Catch?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given how much simpler data binding appears compared to writing 
      equivalent code by hand, why should anyone ever again write code to read 
      or write Json (or xml) by hand? There are some legitimate reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Primary problem is that data binding introducing tight and close 
        coupling between data format and Java objects: if one changes, the 
        other must change too. Sometimes this is ok: both can be modified. In 
        other cases it is problematic: you may not be in position to control 
        such changes. And while there are ways to configure binding, override 
        functionality and add handlers, there is diminishing return: at some 
        point it might be better to just bite the bullet and handle it all 
        programmatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Efficiency may be problematic too: some data binding packages 
        introduce significant overhead (speed, memory usage). Fortunately 
        Jackson is not &quot;one of those package&quot;: additional overhead is modest, 
        often in 15-20% range.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data binding is fundamentally non-streaming: so this approach does not 
        work for huge data streams, without some modifications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of these, second and third can usually be resolved: performance may not 
      be a problem to begin with, and partial streaming (chunking) can be 
      achieved by binding sub-sections of content at a time, not the whole 
      document, as long as there are suitable sections that can be processed 
      independently.<br>For example:
    </p>
    <pre> String doc = &quot;[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]&quot;;
 JsonParser jp = new JsonFactory().createJsonParser(doc);
 ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

 jp.nextToken(); // START_ARRAY
 while (jp.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_ARRAY) {
   Integer I = mapper.readValue(jp, Integer.class);
   // will point to &quot;last event used for the Object&quot;, i.e. VALUE_NUMBER_INT itself
 }
 // and would work equally well with beans</pre>
    <p>
      would map each integer value one by one, separately. Same approach would 
      obviously work with individual beans, Lists and Maps as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this leaves the main problem: that of highly dynamic, non-structured 
      or dynamically typed content. This is where the last processing approach 
      may come in handy.... and that will be the subject of my next sermon. 
      Drive safely!
    </p></p>

      (for background, refer to the earlier <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/01/entry_131.html">&quot;Three 
      Ways to Process Json&quot;</a> entry)
    </p>
    <p>
      To continue with the thesis of &quot;exactly 3 methods to process structured 
      data formats (including Json)&quot;, let's have look at the first alleged 
      method, &quot;Iterating over Event Streams&quot; (for reading; and &quot;Writing to an 
      Event Stream&quot; for writing).<br>I must have already written a bit 
      about this approach, given that it is the approach that <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson</a> 
      has used from the very beginning. But, as romans put it: &quot;Repetitio est 
      mater studiorum&quot;. So let's have a (yet another) look at how Jackson 
      allows applications to process Json content via Stream-of-Events (SoE ?) 
      abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Reading from Stream-of-Events</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Stream-of-Events is just a logical abstraction, not a concrete 
      thing, first thing to decide is how to expose it. There are multiple 
      possibilities; and here too there are 3 commonly used alternatives:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        As iteratable stream of Event Objects. This is the approach taken by 
        Stax Event API. Benefits include simplicity of access, and object 
        encapsulation which allows for holding onto Event objects during 
        processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        As callbacks that denote Events as they happen, passing all data as 
        callback arguments. This is the approach SAX API uses. It is highly 
        performant and type-safe (each callback method, one per event type, 
        can have distinct arguments) but may be cumbersome to use from 
        application perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a logical cursor that allows accessing concrete data regarding one 
        event at a time: This is the approach taken by Stax Cursor API. The 
        main benefit over event objects approach is the performance (similar 
        to that of callback approach): no additional objects are constructed 
        by the framework; and the application has to create objects if it 
        needs any. And the main benefit over callback approach is simplicity 
        of access by the application: no need to register callback handlers, 
        no &quot;Hollywood principle&quot; (don't call us, we call you), just simple 
        iteration over events using the cursor.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Jackson uses the third approach, exposing a logical cursor as 
      &quot;JsonParser&quot; object. This choice was done by choosing combination of 
      convenience and efficiency (other choices would offer one but not both 
      of these). The entity used as cursor is named &quot;parser&quot; (instead of 
      something like &quot;reader&quot;) to closely align with the Json specification; 
      the same principle is followed by the rest of API (so structured set of 
      key/value fields is called &quot;Object&quot;, and a sequence of values &quot;Array&quot; -- 
      alternate names might make sense, but it seemed like a good idea to try 
      to be compatible with the data format specification first!).
    </p>
    <p>
      To iterate the stream, application advances the cursor by calling 
      &quot;JsonParser.nevToken()&quot; (Jackson prefers term &quot;token&quot; over &quot;event&quot;). And 
      to access data and properties of the token cursor points to, calls one 
      of accessors which will refer to property of currently pointed-to token. 
      This design was inspired by Stax API (which is used for processing XML 
      content), but modified to better reflect specific features of Json.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the basic ideas is pretty simple. But to give better idea of the 
      details, let's make up an example. This one will be based on the 
      Json-based data format described at <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Search+API+Documentation">http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Search+API+Documentation</a> 
      (and using first record entry of the sample document too), but using 
      some simplifications (omitting fields, renaming).
    </p>
    <pre>{
  &quot;id&quot;:1125687077,
  &quot;text&quot;:&quot;@stroughtonsmith You need to add a \&quot;Favourites\&quot; tab to TC/iPhone. Like what TwitterFon did. I can't WAIT for your Twitter App!! :) Any ETA?&quot;,
  &quot;fromUserId&quot;:855523, 
  &quot;toUserId&quot;:815309,
  &quot;languageCode&quot;:&quot;en&quot;
}</pre>
    <p>
      And to contain data parsed from this Json content, let's use a container 
      Bean like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <pre>public class TwitterEntry
{
  long _id;  
  String _text;
  int _fromUserId, _toUserId;
  String _languageCode;

  public TwitterEntry() { }

  public void setId(long id) { _id = id; }
  public void setText(String text) { _text = text; }
  public void setFromUserId(int id) { _fromUserId = id; }
  public void setToUserId(int id) { _toUserId = id; }
  public void setLanguageCode(String languageCode) { _languageCode = languageCode; }

  public int getId() { return _id; }
  public String getText() { return _text; }
  public int getFromUserId() { return _fromUserId; }
  public int getToUserId() { return _toUserId; }
  public String getLanguageCode() { return _languageCode; }

  public String toString() {
    return &quot;[Tweet, id: &quot;+_id+&quot;, text='&quot;;+_text+&quot;', from: &quot;+_fromUserId+&quot;, to: &quot;+_toUserId+&quot;, lang: &quot;+_languageCode+&quot;]&quot;;
  }
}</pre>
    <p>
      With this setup let's try creating an instance of this Bean from sample 
      data above.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, here is a method that can read Json content via event stream and 
      populate the bean:
    </p>
    <pre> TwitterEntry read(JsonParser jp) throws IOException
 {
  // Sanity check: verify that we got &quot;Json Object&quot;:
  if (jp.nextToken() != JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {
    throw new IOException(&quot;Expected data to start with an Object&quot;);
  }
  TwitterEntry result = new TwitterEntry();
  // Iterate over object fields:
  while (jp.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {
   String fieldName = jp.getCurrentName();
   // Let's move to value
   jp.nextToken();
   if (fieldName.equals(&quot;id&quot;)) {
    result.setId(jp.getLongValue());
   } else if (fieldName.equals(&quot;text&quot;)) {
    result.setText(jp.getText());
   } else if (fieldName.equals(&quot;fromUserId&quot;)) {
    result.setFromUserId(jp.getIntValue());
   } else if (fieldName.equals(&quot;toUserId&quot;)) {
    result.setToUserId(jp.getIntValue());
   } else if (fieldName.equals(&quot;languageCode&quot;)) {
    result.setLanguageCode(jp.getText());
   } else { // ignore, or signal error?
    throw new IOException(&quot;Unrecognized field '&quot;+fieldName+&quot;'&quot;);
   }
  }
  jp.close(); // important to close both parser and underlying File reader
  return result;
 }</pre>
    <p>
      And can be invoked as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>  JsonFactory jsonF = new JsonFactory();
  JsonParser jp = jsonF.createJsonParser(new File(&quot;input.json&quot;));
  TwitterEntry entry = read(jp);</pre>
    <p>
      Ok, now that's quite a bit of code for a relatively simple operation. On 
      plus side, it is simple to follow: even if you have never worked with 
      Jackons or json format (or maybe even Java) it should be easy to grasp 
      what is going on and modify code as necessary. So basically it is 
      &quot;monkey code&quot; -- easy to read, write, modify, but tedious, boring and in 
      its own way error-prone (because of being boring).<br>Another and 
      perhaps more important benefit is that this is actually very fast: there 
      is very little overhead and it does run fast if you bother to benchmark 
      it. And finally, processing is fully streaming: parser (and generator 
      too) only keeps track of the data that the logical cursor currently 
      points to (and just a little bit of context information for nesting, 
      input line numbers and such).
    </p>
    <p>
      Example above hints at possible use case for using &quot;raw&quot; streaming 
      access to Json: places where performance really matters. Another case 
      may be where structure of content is highly irregular, and more 
      automated approached would not work (why this is the case becomes more 
      clear with follow-up articles: for now I just make the claim), or the 
      structure of data and objects has high impedance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Writing to Stream-of-Events</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, so reading content using Stream-of-Events is simple but laborious 
      process. It should be no surprise that writing content is about the 
      same; albeit with maybe just a little bit less unnecessary work. Given 
      that we now have a Bean, constructed from Json content, we might as well 
      try writing it back (after being, perhaps, modified in-between). So 
      here's the method for writing a Bean as Json:
    </p>
    <pre><br>


  private void write(JsonGenerator jg, TwitterEntry entry) throws IOException
  {
    jg.writeStartObject();
    // can either do &quot;jg.writeFieldName(...) + jg.writeNumber()&quot;, or this:
   jg.writeNumberField(&quot;id&quot;, entry.getId());
   jg.writeStringField(&quot;text&quot;, entry.getText());
   jg.writeNumberField(&quot;fromUserId&quot;, entry.getFromUserId());
   jg.writeNumberField(&quot;toUserId&quot;, entry.getToUserId());
   jg.writeStringField(&quot;langugeCode&quot;, entry.getLanguageCode());
   jg.writeEndObject();
   jg.close();
  }</pre>
    And here code to call the method:

    <pre>  // let's write to a file, using UTF-8 encoding (only sensible one)
  JsonGenerator jg = jsonF.createJsonGenerator(new File(&quot;result.json&quot;), JsonEncoding.UTF8);
  jg.useDefaultPrettyPrinter(); // enable indentation just to make debug/testing easier
  TwitterEntry entry = write(jg, entry);</pre>
    <p>
      Pretty simple eh? Neither challenging nor particularly tricky to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Conclusions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So as can be seen from above, using basic Stream-of-Events is quite 
      primitive way to process Json content. This results in both benefits 
      (very fast, fully streaming [no need to build or keep an object 
      hierarchy in memory] easy to see exactly what is going on) and drawbacks 
      (verbose code, repetitive).
    </p>
    <p>
      But regardless of whether you will ever use this API, it is good to at 
      least be aware of how this works: this because is what other interfaces 
      build on: data mapping and tree building both internally use the raw 
      streaming API to read and write Json content.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next: let's have a look at a more refined method to process Json: 
      Data Binding... stay tuned!
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">There are Three -- and Only Three -- Ways to Process Json!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-size=3,name=default,font-family=Tahoma,font-style=,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],font-weight=normal,}" margin-top="0">
      With profileration of Json processing packages on Java platform, there 
      seems to be n+1 ways to slice and dice Json. And each library seems to 
      consider its way (be it how obscure) to be the One True Way to do 
      things, without even acknowledging that there might be other ways, or 
      bothering to offer alternative methods itself. This is particularly odd 
      for people with xml background, who are used to standardization to a 
      limited set of APIs, even though as a data format it is much more 
      versatile (and complicated) than Json. So what's with this nonsense 
      about myriad ways to slice and nice a dead simple data format?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll let you in on a secret: there is not just one sensible way to 
      process Json. There also aren't dozens of sensible alternatives. There 
      are exactly 3 methods to this madness.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Iteration</b>: Iterating over Event (or, token) stream
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Binding</b>: Binding Json data into Objects (of your favorite 
        language)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tree Traversal</b>: Building a tree structure (from Json) and 
        traversing it using suitable methods
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To give a better idea of what these mean, let us consider Java Standard 
      APIs for these canonical processing methods:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>SAX</b> and <b>Stax</b>. These are APIs that essentially allow 
        iterating over events: with SAX it's the parser that spams you with 
        the events, and with Stax, you will traverse them at your leisure 
        pace. Push versus Pull, but an event stream all the same. Ditto 
        regarding how events are expressed; as callbacks (SAX), event objects 
        (Stax Event API) or just logical cursor state (Stax Cursor API); just 
        variants of the same approach.
      </li>
      <ol>
        (*) (It is also possible to build more elaborate and convenient 
        facades around this approach: witness <b>StaxMate</b> (&quot;your Stax 
        parser's perfect mate&quot;) with its smooth mellow (and yet surprisingly 
        sophisticated!) approach to efficient xml processing -- but I digress!)
      </ol>
      <li>
        <b>JAXB</b> is the standard for data binding; and while there are n+1 
        alternatives (Jibx, XMLBeans, Castor etc. etc. etc.), they all do the 
        same: convert (Java) Objects to xml and vice versa, some conveniently 
        and efficiently, others less so.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>DOM</b> is the &quot;most standard&quot; API that defines a tree structure 
        and machinery around it; but as with data binding, there are multiple 
        (better) alternatives as well (<b>XOM</b>, <b>JDOM</b>, <b>DOM4j</b>). 
        And you traverse it either node-by-node, or using XPath.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      But these are for xml. How does that relate to Json? Well, turns out, 
      this is one area where the format doesn't matter all that much: all 
      three approaches are valid, useful and relevant with Json as well. And 
      probably with other structure data formats well. But I can not think of 
      a fourth one that would immediately make sense (feel free to prove my 
      ignorance by pointing out something!).
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is the good thing: Your Favorite Json Process (quick! say <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org">Jackson</a>!) 
      implements all said 3 methods. Yay!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Core</b> package (jackson-core) contains <b>JsonParser</b> and <b>JsonGenerator</b>, 
        which allow iterating over tokens
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ObjectMapper</b> implements data binding functionality: Objects in, 
        Json out, Json in, Objects out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>TreeMapper</b> can grow trees (expressed as <b>JsonNode</b>s) from 
        Json, and print Json out of a JsonNode (and its children).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Hence, I have proven that the number is Three; that Three is a Good 
      Number; and that Jackson Does Three. So Jackson is All Good. QED.
    </p></p>

<div class="entry" id="post-130">
			<h3 class="entry-header">More Action, Jackson! (0.9.6) Thaw Me Objects!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      So here's another Jackson release, this time version 0.9.6. Although the 
      version difference is miniscule (just patch level increase -- we are 
      running out of pre-1.0 version numbers here!), this is another rather 
      significant upgrade. Why? Because now the Number One feature request -- 
      Full Bean/POJO de-serialization (read Java objects from Json) -- is 
      finally implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how do I do it? It is actually rather simple in most cases: try this:
    </p>
    <pre>  MyBean bean = new ObjectMapper().readValue(jsonFile, MyBean.class);
  // maybe something that you earlier wrote using &quot;mapper.writeValue(bean, 
  jsonFile);&quot;?</pre>
    <p>
      The only requirement is that MyBean has suitable access methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Getters (String getName() etc) are needed to serialize (write Objects 
        as Json)
      </li>
      <li>
        Setters (setName(String)) are needed to deserialize (read Objects from 
        Json)
      </li>
      <li>
        for deserialization, a no-arg default constructor is also needed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In future there may be additional serialization mechanisms (perhaps 
      field-based introspection; and certainly annotations to rename 
      properties and indicate methods with less regular names), but for now 
      above will (have to) suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to handling beans well, support for Generics containers 
      works as expected: the only caveats are that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For properties of beans, full Generic type must be included in the set 
        method for deserialization (not needed for serialization)
      </li>
      <li>
        For root-level object type, basic class is not enough (do not try 
        'List l = mapper.readValue(src, List.class);', won't work): instead 
        you must do: 'List&lt;String&gt; l = mapper.readValue(src, new 
        TypeReference&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;() { } );'. This complexity is due to Java 
        Type Erasure (see earlier blog entries for more details)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So what else is new with 0.9.6? Packaging for one: Jackson now comes in 
      2 jars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &quot;Core&quot; contains JsonParser and JsonGenerator APIs, implementations
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;Mapper&quot; contains 2 mappers: &quot;ObjectMapper&quot; that does data binding 
        mentioned above, and &quot;TreeMapper&quot; that can construct DOM-like trees 
        that consist of JsonNode objects. Latter are convenient for more 
        dynamic (scripting-like) access and traversal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As usual: if you have already used Jackson, do us all favour and 
      download &amp; use the new version! And if not, well, perhaps download and 
      try out the new version! You will like it.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Viva Tequila! Woodstox 4.0.0 released</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      By now this is bit of yesterday's news, but better late than never: 
      Woodstox version 4.0.0, known as &quot;Tequila&quot;, was released first thing 
      this year (January first). Check out <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org/Download">Download 
      page</a> for artifacts (Woodstox is now composed of 2 mandatory jars, 
      see below; and optional ones for RelaxNG/XML Schema validation support), 
      and <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org/4.0.0/release-notes/VERSION">release 
      notes</a> for details of what's new.
    </p>
    <p>
      For very high-level overview here are the things I consider these the 
      highlights compared to 3.2:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Typed Access API: read and write native data conveniently and 
        efficiently. Types supported is a subset of standard XML Schema 
        datatypes including primitives (numbers like ints, booleans, qualified 
        xml names), arrays (of numbers) and binary (base64). I think the last 
        may be the most important one, since it finally allows efficient, 
        reliable and convenient transfer of inline binary data within xml. I 
        hope to benchmark benefits in near future.
      </li>
      <li>
        XML Schema Validation: in addition to existing DTD and RelaxNG 
        validation, one can now validate content (using the same Stax2 
        Validation API), both when reading and writing xml. Implementation 
        uses Sun Multi-Schema Validator as the underlying validation engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improvement interoperability:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Improvement support for reading/writing DOM documents, elements: 
            namespace-repairing mode implemented for writing. And Typed Access 
            API works completely too (if not as efficiently as with Stax API)
          </li>
          <li>
            OSGi: Woodstox jars (and included MSV jars too) are OSGi bundles
          </li>
          <li>
            Maven: better structuring of jars (now Woodstox core is one jar, 
            Stax2 API a separate and required jar)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As always: Download Responsibly! (simple rule of thumb: a Tequila 
      Sunrise, sweet -- Tequila Sunset, one too many!)
    </p></p>

      All possible workarounds listed require creating dummy classes (3 
      mentioned, plus one I forgot about, that of class member/static 
      variables); but the most promising approach is probably that of using 
      sub-classing. The first thought I had was to perhaps require 
      sub-classing the specific class or interface and providing type 
      information that way. For example, to specify type 
      &quot;HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;&quot;, you would define a class like:
    </p>
    <pre>  public class MyDummyMap extends HashMap&lt;String,String&gt; { }</pre>
    <p>
      And then pass &quot;MyDummyMap.class&quot; as the type argument to whatever 
      methods needs this type information. This would work in many cases; for 
      abstract classes and interfaces you could just define class as abstract. 
      After all, we don't need instances of the class, just the class to 
      provide type information for the &quot;Real Type&quot; we want.
    </p>
    <p>
      However while this does allow functionality, it is not optimal from 
      robustness perspective: after all, type of the argument itself is just 
      Class&lt;?&gt;. Further, caller has to know the class has to sub-class 
      something, and provide full generic typing. It sure would be nice to 
      have more descriptive type for the argument; as well as some static (and 
      if need be, dynamic) error checking to ensure that type information is 
      properly passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2008/12/entry_126.html">&quot;Super 
      Type Tokens&quot;</a> (courtesy of Java Guru mr. Gafter) comes in -- and 
      I'm glad I happened to find it when googling for solutions to the 
      problem. The idea is obvious once you know it: instead of sub-classing 
      the parametrized class, define an abstract reference class and sub-class 
      that reference (which, then, is statically typed and explicitly known to 
      be a form of type reference). It allows for ensuring that typing is 
      provided, and with some additional tricks (such as a reader's suggestion 
      of making TypeReference implement a dummy interface such as Comparable) 
      can be explicit, easy-to-understand, concise and reliable way to pass 
      exact type information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even better, implementation from these ideas is quite simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A possible implementation is as follows (this one adapted from Jackson 
      codebase):
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public abstract class TypeReference&lt;T&gt;
  implements Comparable&lt;TypeReference&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{
 final java.lang.reflect.Type _type;

 protected TypeReference()
 {
  java.lang.reflect.Type superClass = getClass().getGenericSuperclass();
  _type = ((ParameterizedType) superClass).getActualTypeArguments()[0];
 }

 public Type getType() { return _type; }

 // We define this method (and require implementation of Comparable
 // to prevent constructing a reference without type information.
 public int compareTo(TypeReference&lt;T&gt; o) {
  return 0; // dummy, never used
 }
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      And usage would be like:
    </p>
    <p>
      Decoder d = DecoderFactory.forTypeReference(new 
      TypeReference&lt;HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;() { } );
    </p>
    <p>
      which seems clear enough -- even if ideally Java language would have 
      explicit support for proper type information passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only minor annoyance I have left with this is the profileration of 
      these disposable dummy classes, only purpose of which is to contain 
      little bit of type information. But I'll take this solution over not 
      having any. :-)
