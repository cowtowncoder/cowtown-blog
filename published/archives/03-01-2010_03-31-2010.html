			<h3 class="entry-header">Welcome HP, So Long Dell (and don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (warning: this is another rant. Sorry!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's another improvement in my daily life: after more than a year of 
      space-shuttle-lift-off noise, short-but-brutish uptimes, and countless 
      curses, family's lean old Dell XP &quot;work&quot;station is out for good. Its 
      only agreeable attribute was its slim neat looks (and sort of neat 
      mechanism used for case, allowing its easy opening -- too bad there's 
      not much to do even if you can open it easily). Good riddance, music to 
      my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The replacement, HP Pavilion Slimline, actually looks every bit as good 
      as its predecessor. But otherwise the two are polar opposites: new box 
      is quiet, as reliable as expected (i.e., &quot;just works&quot;), and its only 
      design flaw is that it comes with an OS written by a company based in 
      Redmond. But that I can live with, since it's not my work machine. :-)<br>And 
      even Windows seems to have improved a bit between versions (new one has 
      Windows 7, previous one whatever preceded Vista).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: I just thought I'll share my distaste with Dell products (maybe 
      I should actually include &quot;not-so-good&quot; lists on my semi-professional 
      home page?) now that I am getting rid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all started couple of years ago, when I decided to stop wasting my 
      time on building my own PCs from components (which made sense after 
      college, could save some money). I figured that with time I spent 
      building PCs, and then troubleshooting problems with components,  it 
      just didn't make a whole lot of sense. And so I thought I'd go with 
      something that other customers in general had found usable: back then 
      Dell had highest customer ratings of all PC companies; and save for one 
      friend of mine (who had already fought with Dell's phone &quot;support&quot; 
      people, due to problems with memory chips that were failing; and that no 
      amount of rebooting would ever fix), I wasn't aware of huge problems 
      with the company or its products.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I found out by experience makes me suspect that the company that 
      had gotten good reviews had been abducted by aliens, and replaced by an 
      ersatz replica or something. Correlation between happy customers and 
      company that produced crap I bought just is not there. I am not talking 
      about customer support (no point calling them wrt. badly designed piece 
      of hardware, IMO, it is not not something a script-reading underpaid 
      remote helper can help a lot with), but rather about quality of 
      hardware. My experience beyond PC fiasco was that their products are 
      competitively priced, but have low quality. For example, laser printer 
      that I bought to replace trusty old Apple writer (which, after having 
      bought second hand, served us for 8 years; for total lifetime of 
      probably 15 years; and would have worked well but I couldn't find new 
      toner cartridges for reasonable prices any more!) was inexpensive, and 
      worked fine for a while. Like, maybe a year. And then broke down. The 
      only thing left are LCD monitors, which I have to admit were reasonably 
      priced, and still work. In fact both are still in active use. So I guess 
      they do produce something other than lemons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about that last sentence: I guess I could put my feelings into 
      fitting slogan: <b>Dell -- General Motors of Computers</b>.<br>Feel free 
      to quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. I am happy to admit that after kicking that incompetent CEO of 
      theirs out, HP seems to have done nice comeback. Good for them, and us.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Tatu's new Semi-Professional Home Page</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      (note: semi-professional refers to contents and NOT to construction of 
      page itself -- page can be considered totally amateurish in its design 
      and implementation -- but things contained are related to my 
      Professional development, including its career-development aspects)
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok here is something old recycled as something new: behold, <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/TatuSaloranta">Tatu's 
      Semi-Professional home page</a> at FasterXML wiki.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to combine information on state of public projects I work on 
      and public material I would like to share with others, in a somewhat 
      compact and less transient form. Blogs are good for publishing some 
      information; but over time things tend to bury under other things. Plus, 
      form of articles, as well as regular Wiki pages, are more for slightly 
      deeper content. I needed a simple link collection, like book index. So 
      that's what this aims to be, personal-but-public index. Like what home 
      pages used to be, sort of... and hey, you can probably spot the Vintage 
      90s sign of &quot;Work in Progress&quot; attitude to writing and updating the 
      thing. Who'd have thank that 90s became retro so fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: although reading through the page should be challenge to anyone 
      who can read my blog entries, here's yet more condensed take on 
      contents; index of the index (IoI?). What we got is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Summary of (open source) projects I am closely involved with; along 
        with near-term plan
      </li>
      <li>
        List of lists, &quot;Best of&quot;; things I think others might be interested in
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And that's it for now. Will refactor as needed (I'm sure I'll have to 
      reinvent multi-level indexing structure soon); add things that seem 
      worth adding.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Non-intuitive aspects of Git: handling of remote branches (especially creation)</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Lately I have gotten to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a> 
      as it is the production SCM of choice for my new employer (having 
      recently taken over from Subversion). This is generally a good thing: 
      while I had learnt to like p4 after using it for a while (and especially 
      after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Perforce-Laura-Wingerd/dp/0596101856">&quot;Practical 
      Perforce&quot;</a>), and appreciate svn's finally replacing cvs as the 
      &quot;default open-source SCM, there is something to be said about efficient 
      distributed SCM system. And there is lots of excitement behind svn: 
      consensus is building that Git will become the de facto SCM for 
      open-source development.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part Git has proven to be worth the hype it has generated 
      and working with it has been easy. But the first real speed bump for me 
      was trying to get branches to work. Most documentation focuses on 
      working with local branches (which are usually &quot;personal&quot;, single user 
      branchs), which have their uses for development by large teams, or 
      heavily shared codebases. Nothing wrong with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for my own uses day-to-day uses with open source projects, it is 
      so-called remote branches (ones that live on shared &quot;master&quot; repository) 
      that matter more. Specifically, branches used for &quot;legacy&quot; versions, 
      needed for adding patches for versions other than the most recently 
      released stable: having &quot;1.3&quot; and &quot;1.4&quot; branches while 
      trunk/mainline/master being used for upcoming &quot;1.5&quot; version (for 
      example).
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is where things get bit unintuive and complicated. Fortunately, 
      after googling for an hour, I found <a href="http://www.zorched.net/2008/04/14/start-a-new-branch-on-your-remote-git-repository/">this 
      article</a>, which gave me specific recipe I needed:
    </p>
    <pre># 1. Create the remote branch
git push origin origin:refs/heads/new_feature_name

# 2. Make sure everything is up-to-date
git fetch origin<br><br># 3. Then you can see that the branch is created.
# (this should show ‘origin/new_feature_name’)
git branch -r

# 4. Start tracking the new branch
git checkout --track -b new_feature_name origin/new_feature_name

# 5. Make sure everything is up-to-date
git pull</pre>
    <p>
      plus absolute necessary follow-up for &quot;Cleaning up Mistakes&quot;:
    </p>
    <pre># If you make a mistake you can always delete the remote branch
git push origin :heads/new_feature_name</pre>
    <p>
      and that's it. I hope. If not, I'm sure to gripe about that in future. 
      :-)
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Naively Simple, and Very Powerful: WebSockets!</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      I don't know how I have managed to miss the next &quot;Simple Big Thing&quot;, but 
      I noticed that something called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">WebSockets</a> 
      has been around for months. And yet I only now bumped into (via 
      announcement for Jetty 8, which boasts support for Servlet 3 API as well 
      as WebSockets). Better late than never I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea with WS is very simple, and even somewhat elegant: start up 
      with a regular HTTP connect with hand shake, and then convert it to what 
      amounts to a socket. And use simple properties of UTF-8 encoding to 
      provide simple and inexpensive framing mechanism. Start and end markers 
      used are bytes 0x00 and 0xFF which can not be included in UTF-8 encoded 
      textual data (along with couple of other bytes); and this mostly 
      guarantees that you can nicely included structured textual data using 
      XML or JSON. In fact, elegance of the solution reminds me of UTF-8 
      encoding which also is surprisingly well designed and simple. In fact, 
      ability of WebSockets to do what it is doing is yet another testament 
      for pure goodness of UTF-8 encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, this is just a heads up, just in case some of you may have 
      missed this important development. Believe me, this is going to be a big 
      thing very soon. Comet begone; WebSockets is the way forward for 
      efficient low-latency stateful interaction!

			<h3 class="entry-header">Using H2 as embedded in-memory database</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Lately (as in this week) I have had to do some work with relational 
      databases (argh!) -- nothing too bad, pretty basic stuff, something 
      where BDB would work mostly fine, but where accessibility dictates more 
      shareable alternative.<br>But for testing purposes, I much rather have 
      something fully controllable from within JVM instead of having to deploy 
      a repliace of DB that will be used for production.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately there are multiple viable choices; and just based on 
      personal preferences I decided to try out <a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">H2</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Detour: why H2?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of my reasoning is due to seemingly healthy activity on mailing 
      lists; and another part is the feature set (which is extensive). But 
      ultimately it mostly comes down to the fact that project and its author 
      seem very much like archetypical examples of Good Open Source Project 
      (and its leader); specifically project that has a single author that
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        has strong vision regarding what the product should be about, and
      </li>
      <li>
        has actually &quot;done it before&quot;; either implemented a similar product 
        before (in this case, hypersonicSQL, and even more) or worked in 
        domain, and
      </li>
      <li>
        is a competent developer all-around, outside his/her specific domain
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But I digress. I just thought I'll mention how much good leadership 
      means for Open Source projects, and why it is perhaps the best indicator 
      for quality of project output (this is why Saxon is so good; why Jersey 
      kicks ass; and so forth); much more so than branding (yes, being a 
      &quot;Google project&quot; gives you plenty of insta-karma, but means surprisingly 
      little with regards to quality).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Ok, so How Do I Start the Thing?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: back to what I was doing... a t first I spend quite a bit of 
      time trying to read through documentation (which does exist; not in 
      abundance, but in large enough quantities) trying to figure out how to 
      start up database in embedded, in-memory mode. From feature set, it is 
      clear that one can run H2 in embedded mode; and further, fully in-memory 
      (as an alternative to disk-based persistence). But somehow I failed to 
      initially realize how simple this is, and tried to figure out with 
      Server/Service (TCP, HTTP or PG == Postgres) is needed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out the right answer is &quot;none of above&quot;. In fact, you don't need 
      to start anything. Rather:<b> &quot;if you call it, it will be there&quot;</b>.<br>Literally: 
      database will spring to existence if you try connecting to it via JDBC, 
      using special URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... d'oh! But of course. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Really? Are you kidding me?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you wrap your brains around this Zen-y idea, it starts to make more 
      sense (and also suggest at one issue to overcome -- database will also, 
      by default, be gone when the last connection closes -- this can be 
      easily resolved, more on this later)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, just to help anyone else who might just be googling for the answer; 
      it is JDBC connection String that matters. I use something like:
    </p>
    <pre>  jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</pre>
    <p>
      (where 'test' is logical name of the database, needed to allow multiple 
      connections)
    </p>
    <p>
      so, for example:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre> DataSource ds = JdbcConnectionPool.create(&quot;jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot;);
 Connection conn = ds.getConnection();
 conn.createStatement().executeUpdate(&quot;CREATE TABLE data (&quot;
   +&quot; key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   +&quot; value VARCHAR(1023) )&quot;);
 // ... populate with data, test etc
 conn.close();</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      and that's all. No need to start anything else up unless you actually 
      want DB to serve external connections. Oh, and if you do: yes, you can 
      actually expose embedded and/or in-memory databases (these are 
      orthogonal choices!) to external clients too.<br>Connecting is done 
      either using straight JDBC, or using simple connection pool H2 comes 
      equipped with, which actually seems functional enough for most needs. I 
      think I like this little (?) database already; it makes writing unit 
      tests a breeze, obviously. But I suspect it could also act as somewhat 
      production ready light-weight - yet - non-toy SQL database. We shall see.
    </p>
    <p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">No pain, no gain: on sweetness of hard-won victory, US health care reform</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Here's another detour from the usual technical content. Just for fun, 
      let's talk about some lighter subject: subjective feeling of rewards, in 
      context of some bigger thing like, say, US health-care reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      As background, I admit that while I have significant interest in 
      on-going process of getting universal health-care available here in the 
      United States, I don't have much to say about goal itself or road there. 
      Much has been said; most of essential aspects, and ton of crap beyond 
      that. So it is enough to state that my father is an M.D (outside of US); 
      that I have been familiar with amounts US overpays for its health-care 
      (100-150% higher per capita than any other country -- this has been 
      widely known since 90s); and that I am aware of how much good that 
      spending has done to national health, statistically (wrt. infant 
      mortality, life expectancy -- very little). And from this you can deduce 
      what I think is the right way forward.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      But regardless of my personal opinions, there are still things I find 
      interesting about the meta-process. Here are some easy predictions to 
      make, assuming reform bill passes (which seems quite probably at this 
      point):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sky is not going to fall: it is enough to look back in history for all 
        significant changes, from end of Prohibition, to US social security 
        system bootstrapping to civil liberties, to welfare system reform. 
        Things are not going to be altogether different, even if things got 
        royally clustered on short term (wrt. systemic changes)
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate of improvement is going to be slow: system doesn't even kick in 
        for couple of years; but beyond that, well, there is always huge 
        inertia with bigger changes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are trivially obvious things. But there is one more easy 
      prediction to make, something based on basic behavioral psychology, that 
      I find more interesting:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        People who are rooting for the reform will find passage of the 
        Health-care bill VERY rewarding, especially so on short term.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Why so? Isn't it &quot;known truth&quot; that this bruising long process takes joy 
      out of victory? That there's long process of healing yadda yadda?
    </p>
    <p>
      No: absolutely on contrary! It has been proven time and again that the 
      reward one gets from achievements is proportional to effort that was 
      needed to get it done (in case of outside observers, effort may well 
      just consist of following up on events and of emotional attachment, 
      worry and so on -- nonetheless more involvement than with most political 
      causes)
    </p>
    <p>
      So if the reform had passed easily, it would have gotten at most 
      lukewarm feeling of accomplishment, soon to be diluted by other matters. 
      Bigger the fight and fiercer the resistance, the sweeter is overcoming 
      of these obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And guess what? Both sides know this, at some instinctive level. Why 
      they don't seem to know it at conscious level I don't know. Or perhaps 
      it just seems better not to spell it out. But to figure this out, you 
      just have to read, say, &quot;Predicably Irrational&quot; (chapter about trying to 
      buy season tickets from no-lifers who have spent almost a year doing 
      stupid stunts, to get the tickets; and value them almost an order of 
      magnitude higher than ones who did NOT get the tickets, after similar 
      amount of effort), or about any other recent pop behavioral science book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, given this, I'm pretty sure Obama team knows this; and 
      possibly made good use of it during campaigning (they won it, and 
      supporters got nice kick out of prolonged battle -- this, too, was 
      researched [I saw a reference from SciAm, forget where the study was 
      published]). They seem well-versed in theory (and perhaps practical art) 
      of basic behavioral patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to host parties like ones they have 
      after one's national team has won soccer world cup or something. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. Of course, if the effort was to fail, its opponents would get 
      similar highs, enjoy the rewards. Hitting the brick with your fist only 
      hurts if the dang thing does NOT break.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Annotation Frustrations: not allowing null-valued Annotation properties</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      Annotations are a great feature that JDK 1.5 brought along. Along with 
      enumerations and generics it vastly improved Java usability. And 
      compared to generics, annotations are rather easy to understand and use.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      But considering how good annotations are in general, there are two 
      irritating aspects -- like two sore thumbs -- that sort of ruin perfect 
      harmony between my Java-dev happiness, and Java annotations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
        Inability to use plain old null as annotation value: no, you 
        absolutely can not define null as annotation property value; neither 
        explicitly, nor implicitly (can only omit annotation properties with 
        default value, and default value can not be null)
      </li>
      <li>
        Inability to use &quot;any enum value&quot; as value (possibly with generic 
        annotations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      Of these, latter is annoying, and prevents some use cases (say, ability 
      to define an enum and use it as ordered constants for versioning via 
      annotations), but I can see why there may be technical limitations. 
      Enumeration implementation is bit convoluted when you get down to 
      low-level details (just for fun, try to figure out what is the REAL type 
      of enumeration values, via Introspection... think they are fields? think 
      again!)<br>But former... whoever thought that null would be useless as 
      annotation property value made a huge disservice to Java developers. 
      Null is absolutely crucial value to have. It's like having numeric 
      system without value zero.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      So why does this matter? Basically, not having null as an option means 
      that one has to create null surrogates: values that imitate nulls. For 
      example, assume that you want to allow adding custom handlers via 
      annotations (for, say, JSON serializer to use for a type): you can 
      define an annotation property with value of Class&lt;IntendedType&gt; (yes, 
      generics work just fine here). But you can not easily make its use 
      optional: so, if you do not want to define such handler (common case), 
      there is no easy way to do it.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      The usual work-around, then, is to do two things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
        Create a dummy class (abstract class MyAnnotation.NoHandler extends 
        Handler { } )
      </li>
      <li>
        Assign this dummy class as the default value for said property
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      This works, but is ugly. And gets even uglier when annotation property 
      has String type -- that's where those funky &quot;##default-name##&quot; constants 
      for JAXB come from.
    </p>
    <p resolver="NamedStyle:default {name=default,font-size=3,font-style=,font-weight=normal,font-family=Tahoma,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],}" margin-top="0">
      And all this instead of the obvious Right Solution: allowing annotation 
      properties to have value of null. It would be interesting hear plausible 
      explanations for this omission.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Jackson 1.5: Polymorphic Type Handling, first steps</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Now that <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease15">Jackson 1.5</a> 
      is out (ready for <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonDownload">download</a>?), 
      it's good to start reviewing some candies from the goody bag. While 1.5 
      is, technically speaking, a &quot;minor&quot; release it is nothing but grand 
      judging by number of added features .<br>In a way Jackson mirrors 
      development of JDK: Jackson version 1.2 and 1.5 have contained tons of 
      new stuff, whereas 1.3 and 1.4 have been more about incremental steady 
      improvements and bug fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with the top requested new feature: <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization">Polymorphic 
      Type Handling</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Polymorphic Types: not just for serialization any more!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      First things first: polymorphic types just refer to cases where there is 
      a single declared property type (say, Animal), but multiple concrete 
      subtypes (like Dog and Cat). Basic OO stuff, implemented in Java by 
      sub-classes and interface implementation. Nothing unusual there.<br>Challenge 
      is actually that of mapping this cleanly to data formats: as with 
      relational model (SQL) and hierarchic model (XML), JSON has no native 
      concept of inheritance (XML has neither, in itself; XML Schema does add 
      support however).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson has actually supported serialization of all types, including 
      polymorphic subtypes, since first data binding enabled versions (0.9.5). 
      This because Jackson by default uses actual runtime type when 
      determining serializer to use (although it can be configured to only 
      static, declared type, too) -- which is different from what JAXB does -- 
      and thus has no trouble writing out all properties sub-type has.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem is, without additional type information, it is not 
      possible to determine intended subtype when deserializing, when there 
      are multiple subtypes to choose from: when property has declared type of 
      'Animal', there is no way to know whether it should be reconstructed as 
      &quot;Dog&quot; or &quot;Cat&quot;. This is where PTH implementation comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious answer is that additional type information must be added in 
      serialized JSON data to allow this later reconstruction. But there are 
      multiple considerations as to how this should be done, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What kind of type information should be included (Java class name? 
        Logical type name? something else?)
      </li>
      <li>
        How (where) should this type information be included (as a property? 
        using wrapper constructs?)
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we always have to include this type information? (doing so adds 
        unnecessary bloat in cases where type information is redundant)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Jackson 1.5 tackles these (and some other minor concerns) in an 
      efficient, configurable, and I hope, elegant way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Enough theory: show me the code!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: chances are that you are not all THAT interested in details of how 
      implementation was tricky, or what philosophical considerations went on 
      in determining what to implement and how. So let's start with some toy 
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering case of a polymorphic class; say... Person base class, and 
      Employee and Customer sub-classes (I have written an &quot;Animal example&quot; at 
      FX wiki already, let's get some variety), and using a wrapper class such 
      as:
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public class Contact {
 public Person initiator; // who initiated contact
 public Person receiver; // with whome?
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      and Person (etc) classes as follows
    </p>
    <hr>
    

    <pre>public abstract class Person {
 String name;
}

public class Employee extends Person {
 long employeeId;
}

public class Customer extends Person {
 String ssn;
 ServiceLevel serviceLevel;
}</pre>
    <hr>
    

    <p>
      What do we need to do to make Contact properly deserializable? By 
      default, no additional type information would be added, and 
      deserialization would fail
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main ways to do this, covering slightly different use 
      cases, and offering different levels of configurability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Type Info, method #1: explicit annotations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      First method is to add explicit @JsonTypeInfo annotation in the declared 
      type (or its supertypes):
    </p>
    <pre>@JsonTypeInfo(use=JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include=JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property=&quot;@class&quot;)
public abstract class Person {
  //...
}  </pre>
    <p>
      which would basically enable addition of type information for any 
      instances of Person, as well as its subtypes. With above configuration 
      -- include fully-qualified Java class name as type identifier; include 
      it as main-level additional (meta-)property using property name &quot;@class&quot; 
      -- output might look something like:
    </p>
    <pre>{
  <b>&quot;@class&quot; : &quot;com.fasterxml.sample.Employee&quot;,</b>
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Billy Bacon&quot;,
  &quot;employeeId&quot; : 126509
}</pre>
    <p>
      (with additional type information bolded)
    </p>
    <p>
      So far so good: it is bit extra work to sprinkle annotations (which can 
      be added via mix-ins, of course), but nothing too bad. As long as you 
      know types in advance. And you can configure handling pretty well (check 
      out <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJavaDocs">Javadocs</a> for 
      more details for @JsonTypeInfo, related; or if I get that far, later 
      entries on advanced topics)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Type info, method #2: default typing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is another way, which requires much less code, although 
      offering bit less configurability. Specifically, you can enable 
      so-called &quot;default typing&quot; for ObjectMapper by:
    </p>
    <pre>  mapper.enableDefaultTyping(); // defaults for defaults (see below); include as wrapper-array, non-concrete types
  mapper.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL, JsonTypeInfo.As.WRAPPER_OBJECT); // all non-final types</pre>
    <p>
      which would then apply default type information (type id is always 
      fully-qualified Java class; inclusion method is customizable but 
      defaults to &quot;wrapper array&quot;) to all types (classes) that fulfill 
      applicability criteria: by default it would be <i>Object.class</i> and 
      non-concrete types (abstract classes, interfaces). So in our case this 
      would work, given that Person is an abstract class: and if it wasn't, we 
      could use &quot;ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL&quot; to include type 
      information on all non-final classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Is that All?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not at all. This is just the simplest way to start safely handling 
      polymorphic types like, say, <i>List&lt;Object&gt;</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What else there is to find is good subject for follow-up entries, but 
      here are some teasers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Java class name is not a good choice when you have non-Java clients or 
        services to talk to -- if so, you can use &quot;logical type name&quot; (see 
        @JsonTypeName and @JsonSubTypes for more info); much like what JAXB 
        does. Or, even further, you can have fully customized type id 
        converters! (as long as they can convert to/from JSON Strings)
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don't like using main-level property names (maybe there's a 
        conflict), you can use other styles; &quot;wrapper Object&quot;, &quot;wrapper Array&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        If you like default typing, but don't like its selection criteria, you 
        can create your own: just sub-class default TypeResolverBuilder, 
        assign it to your ObjectMapper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, you can define fully custom type information handler, using <b>@JsonTypeResolver</b> 
        annotation -- this will be nicely integrated with the whole system, 
        you only have to provide actual inclusion, but it will be called for 
        any existing types.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But enough for now... more on 1.5 later.
    </p></p>

			<h3 class="entry-header">Move over BDB? On Tokyo Cabinet, CDB, Redis</h3>
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="entry-body">
		
			<p><p>
      Somehow I have managed to miss obvious competition that is creeping up 
      for crown of best simple non-distributed persistent (disk-based) 
      key-value store. So far choice has been (or so I thought) mostly between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB">BDB</a> 
      flavours: BDB JE (Java Edition) and its slightly older big brother, 
      BDB-C (&quot;native&quot;). And about only other choice would have been a Java 
      clone, <a href="http://jdbm.sourceforge.net/">JDBM</a> (which 
      regrettably hasn't really woken from its hibernating state, despite 
      interest).
    </p>
    <p>
      But it turns out that there are many more choices out there, solid, 
      mature, high-performing choices. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/">Tokyo Cabinet</a> (TC)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html">CDB</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_%28software%29">Constant 
        DB</a> -- and probably a play on fact that 'C' follows 'B' in 
        alphabet), and especially (?) its Java version, <a href="http://www.strangegizmo.com/products/sg-cdb/">sg-cdb</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis_%28data_store%29">Redis</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The three are not exactly equivalent, actually: only Tokyo Cabinet can 
      be seen as exact replacement of BDBs. CDB, for example, is a read-only 
      store. And Redis is an in-memory store, but with memory backup 
      (snapshot, or journaling), and slightly expanded value handling 
      semantics (with some set and list value primitives, for aggregate 
      operations).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      This diversity is actually a good thing, however; as per &quot;right tool for 
      the job&quot; thinking, they all should have specific sweet spots regarding 
      usage. In fact, I could see each of them excel in slightly different 
      tasks. And BDB, too, is probably still the best choice for some use 
      cases; specifically BDB-JE that has pretty good behavior under heavy 
      concurrency scenarios, thanks to its design.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what would those optimal tasks be? That is something that would 
      require actually using them, or at least playing with them, perhaps 
      building simple benchmarks. That sounds like a good idea for some 
      prototyping, for near-term future. :-)
    </p>

      <b>UPDATE</b> (16-Mar-2010): Looks like Redis is getting some more 
      tailwind, as per<a href="http://antirez.com/post/vmware-the-new-redis-home.html">this 
      announcement</a> (Redis author joins VMWare, will work on Redis). Very 
      cool!

      I know this is something that users of <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome">Jackson 
      JSON library</a> must have been craving for longest time: their Very Own 
      Social Network (no? you'd rather have handling of cyclic types? d'oh!)<br>Wait 
      no longer: enter <a href="http://jackson-users.ning.com/">jackson-users.ning.com</a>. 
      Place for developers who know the Right Tool for slicing and dicing JSON 
      on Java platform (or possible, any platform).
    </p>
    <p>
      So what's the point? Besides my own curiosity (and, shall we say, desire 
      to &quot;eat your own dog food&quot;; check out author's profile for more info) -- 
      which was a big factor -- I thought it might be one more way to get more 
      of community feel. Mailing lists are good, blogs and wikis too, but a 
      gathering place with bit of all of them might be even better.<br>We 
      shall see how it all works out -- and thanks to lower threshold for 
      participating (since it's easier to give access, let members edit and 
      add things), you can be important part of making it Work Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      See you there: I'll try sending a nice Virtual Gift for member number 
      100... :-)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. What about blogs over there, and here? My current thinking is that 
      &quot;Jackson Users blog&quot; will focus strongly on Jackson (JSON, data binding, 
      frameworks that use it) issues; whereas CowTown blog will have wider 
      coverage. So it should be more of specialization versus general interest.

      Here's another interesting article: &quot;<a href="http://ice09.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/resting-with-json-in-gaelyk/">RESTing 
      with JSON in Gaelyk</a>&quot;. Looks like Jackson usage on &quot;Google platforms&quot; 
      (Android, GAE) is becoming more of a maintsream thing. This is great for 
      multiple reasons, and multi-platform support is one of (many) goals of 
      Jackson.<br>But just having goals matters little if they are not met. 
      Fortunately, thanks to active user/adopter base, goals are being 
      verified over time; and where there are problems, they usually get 
      resolved in timely matter.
