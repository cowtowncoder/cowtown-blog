     <h3 class="entry-header">Lazy Coder Cuisine: Balsamic Sausage Chunks (aka Venetian Sausage Bites)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      (note: I decided to use title prefix &quot;Lazy Coder Cuisine&quot; to make it 
      easier to find food/drink recipes from the Blog -- who knows, maybe it 
      could even lead to a virtual cook book over time!)
    </p>
    <p>
      On my quest to find recipes with exceptionally high value/effort ratio, 
      I came across this gem. It is basically a very simple snack, offering 
      good taste (if non-stellar looks) with modest effort. To give credit 
      where it is due I found the source recipe (<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/michael-chiarello/venetian-sausage-bites-recipe/index.html">Venetian 
      Sausage Bites)</a> at Food Network web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basic idea is very simple:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take sausage -- uncooked sweet italian sasusage suggested (whatever is 
        convenient package; 6 sausages recommended)
      </li>
      <li>
        Poach (cook in boiling water) for a bit (6 - 7 minutes); slice into 
        bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry slightly on skillet, using as much olive oil as necessary (like 2 
        table spoons) to get bit of color, firm texture
      </li>
      <li>
        Add balsamic vinegar (1 cup; more if you want more sauce), simmer to 
        reduce into syrupy sauce (15 - 20 minutes or s)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And the result is a very tasty cocktail snack, in about half an hour 
      (and probably less if you are in a hurry). Results have interesting 
      looks, charcoal black, which is bit acquired taste; but taste itself has 
      broader appeal I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait! There is room for further simplification (as well as for 
      variation) here. For one, you can just use cooked sausage (and obviously 
      vary different kinds), which gets rid of the second step. And if you 
      like bit of additional fat and salt, feel free not to discard melted fat 
      after step 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is actually kind of cool how flexible balsamic vinegar is; 
      considering how different resulting reduction tastes compared to source 
      material. Plus it is probably easy to further pimp the recipe -- I bet 
      adding bit of cream could not hurt the sauce... maybe even add something 
      like apple sauce for added hint of sweetness (best sauce for ham, for 
      example, adds mustard, cream and apple sauce on fat melted from ham... 
      and maybe dash of pepper).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main consideration here is just what to serve these with, if 
      anything. As cocktail snacks, can definitely serve them stand-alone. But 
      other typical companions of sausages should work well too (serve with 
      scrambled eggs?).

     <h3 class="entry-header">Lazy Coder Cuisine: Making Ciabatta -- lots of work, tasty rewards</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Here is something different within culinary domain. I love good bread, 
      and at times it has been challenging to find good stuff in this 
      continent. But while I have not located all kinds of good breads that 
      exist in northern parts of the old continent, I have found new good 
      things over here. One of those things is ciabatta, which is actually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta">fairly 
      recent invention</a>, despite coming from established culinary 
      superpower of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway: while it is possible to find good ciabatta here in Seattle area, 
      it can be bit pricey. And beside economy, freshness is still a 
      challenge. So I figured that perhaps it might not be beyond my 
      capabilities (or rather, team Saloranta's capabilities -- my wife is a 
      superior chef these days) to bake a decent load of ciabatta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok: we settled for about the first Google hit, and specifically on <a href="http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/ciabatta/Detail.aspx">this 
      recipe</a>. Reading through it, it became clear that this is not one of 
      Lazy Coder's recipes; process is surprisingly lengthy for bread making 
      (granted, variance for kinds of breads is huge), if nothing 
      extra-ordinary. Specifically it's actually possible to get it all done 
      within a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long story short: following recipe closely, and using a 20$ pizza stone 
      from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (pre-heating for bit over suggested 45 minutes) 
      produced 2 rather tasty instances. Even 2 steps that felt tricky 
      (kneading by hand -- I suspect that time mentioned is way overestimate, 
      2 minutes is probably fine -- maybe machines have less torque or 
      something; and getting the thing on pizza stone from parchment paper, 
      should have added flour on parchment) failed to ruin the results. So two 
      thumbs up for the recipe and the idea, as long as you have time and 
      energy to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I would suggest for anyone who tries this is to just double 
      the dose and make 4 Ciabattas: effort is not doubled, and so if you go 
      through the trouble, might as well get enough to eat for a while, or to 
      offer for good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly: one nice thing about Ciabatta is that it is delicious with 
      very little else: for example, with melted butter. Yum.
    </p>
    <p>
      ps. On somewhat related note; another late pleasant finding was that US 
      &quot;genoa salami&quot; is close enough to old world &quot;metwurst&quot; (almost as close 
      as &quot;gypsy salami&quot; which is the best US match so far). Couple this with 
      good cheese (sharp cheddar, emmentaler [aka &quot;swiss cheese&quot;], gouda), and 
      you get pretty close to perfect &quot;default topping&quot; for all kinds of 
      breads -- not just dark sourdough ryebread (finnish specialty), but all 
      kinds of white wheat-based breads too.
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Lazy Coder Cuisine, simple snacks, drinks: (fake) Key Lime Pancakes, Chunky Monkey (drink)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      It has been a while since I have written about food or drinks. That does 
      not mean I hadn't been experimenting with simple to make delicious food 
      and drinks. Rather it is just an indication that one driving force in 
      these experiments has been one of 3 cornerstones of good programmer 
      productivity, laziness. And while that approach can lead to good 
      discoveries, it does not lead to writing of those discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since I just made another nice discovery, and since I am in 
      semi-active blog-writing mood (due to having forced myself to write 
      previous tech-heavy article last night!), let's review 2 simple pieces 
      of good stuff: simple &quot;fake&quot; dessert (or just sweet complement to 
      breakfast), and a simple alcoholic drink. And I am hoping this act of 
      documentation might lead to my remembering more of document-worthy 
      results I have had... if not, I will just need to write some more about 
      blackberry beer or something. But I digress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Key Lime Pancakes </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok. First a disclaimer: this is not really Key Lime anything -- no limes 
      are involved, nor anything from the Key west. Name is just inspired due 
      to similarity of taste to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_lime_pie">Key 
      Lime Pie</a>. So consider this a &quot;fake&quot; recipe, something simple to make 
      that imitates a better known dish. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Making Key Lime Pancakes is rather simple -- very lazy-friendly -- and 
      goes like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make basic pancakes (laziest way: use Walmart's pancake mix, only add 
        water; more refined is to google for buttermilk pancake recipe, use 
        that), make sure to fry them in butter (my preference is salted 
        butter, I assume unsalted is ok for lower sodium intake)
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread thin (or, if you prefer, thick) layer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_curd">Lemon 
        Curd</a> (ready-made one works fine; I used Trader Joe's affordable 
        yet good variant) on pancakes
      </li>
      <li>
        Add whipped cream -- use canned version for additional lazy points (as 
        usual, Trader Joe's has good price/quality ratio), that is, spray some 
        whipped cream on top of lemon curd
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And there you have it! Actually I wish I had taken a snapshot of the 
      result, but either way that would not convey the taste. Sweet taste of 
      food coupled with irresistable satisfaction from making it happen with 
      very low effort AND with limited budget. Good stuff, will be one of 
      desserts included in Tatu's Fenno-American Cookbook, should one get 
      written one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is rather sweet stuff (albeit with nice acidic overtones), 
      it's best to cleanse one's palate with something... which leads us to 
      the second recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Chunky Monkey, the Drink (aka Banana Jack)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One experiment I did over a year ago was to figure out if I could think 
      of a new whiskey based drink. Specifically, a bourbon-based one -- there 
      is no need to commit cardinal sin of spoiling malt whiskys with alien 
      substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of different combinations, only one deserves mention, with recipe like:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour some Bourbon (like Jack Daniel's), say 5cl
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some banana liqueur; ratio to use depends on how strong banana 
        taste one likes; 2-to-1 seems like a reasonable ratio, so 2.5 cl
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This drink can be served cold (if so, pour on ice cubes; not shaved 
      ice), but I actually prefer it warm: whisk(e)ys are sensitive to cold in 
      my opinion.<br>The reason this is a nice drink is that sweetness nicely 
      mellows whiskey taste, similar to how Manhattan cocktail works. And when 
      choosing component ratios properly, drink should not be overly sweet or 
      artificial (one risk with banana liquers)
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope name I chose has not already been taken. I guess I could 
      alternatively also call it &quot;Banana Jack&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Send me patches!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of best things that ever happened to me and my open source projects 
      was that others started using things I wrote. And sent bug reports, 
      improvements ideas and comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In same spirit, if you think of improvement ideas, please do send 
      patches! :-D
    </p></p>

     <h3 class="entry-header">Good News, 2009/Jan: Farming Cool Again, Urban-Agro saving Detroit?</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Color me goofy, but I believe I have written something relevant to this 
      latest interesting article in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/">Fortune</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.cityfarmer.info/2010/01/01/fortune-magazine-can-farming-save-detroit/">&quot;Can 
      Farming Save Detroit?</a>&quot;... lessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes, back in October I did point to a <a href="http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/10/entry_337.html">related 
      Sci-Am article</a> (&quot;The Rise of Vertical Farms&quot; in &quot;Good news is news 
      too...&quot;) that presented and discussed the concept of ultra-modern urban 
      farming. And now Fortune has something more concrete to write about, 
      regarding planned development in Detroit, of all places. It (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_agriculture">Urban 
      agriculture</a> in general and the particular project in specific) 
      actually seems to make lots of sense -- I did not know, for example, 
      that there are no chain super markets in Detroit; and conversely there 
      is lots of vacant land, mostly (formerly) residential (meaning no toxic 
      industrial waste). There's no point in just repeating all potential 
      benefits here: just suffice it to say that if done correctly, it could 
      be a significant win-win-win situation, from environmental as well as 
      quality-of-food aspect. That it would be done by someone rather 
      unexpected is probably a good thing in itself: seems like lately people 
      that are most unexpected to stand up and do something do just that (like 
      mr. Boone with wind mills etc. etc.). Desire to leave positive legacy is 
      a strong driving force, and continues to influence development in US: 
      it's not just Ivy League colleges that get founded by elderly 
      billionaries (and yet some numbskulls are trying to kill inheritance tax 
      -- how freakishly stupid is that? -- but I digress). Saving the world 
      does kind of top the list of things to do, if you want to leave such a 
      legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to being interesting in and of itself, I find it fascinating 
      how ideas enter mainstream gradually. I am pretty sure that Time and 
      Newsweek pick this up in a month or two; then followed by broadcast news 
      (.... sloooowly), and eventually daily print papers (once everyone is 
      about aware of the thing). I guess this is one more thing to read one of 
      these affordable high-quality magazine US market is (still) blessed 
      with, like <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific 
      American</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/">Fortune</a> 
      and <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic 
      Magazine</a> (and there are plenty more -- these just happen to be ones 
      I have time to read): you get to learn about important ideas, concepts 
      and developments slightly ahead of most others. And if you are even more 
      time-constrainted than I am, well, you can just skim Time or Newsweek, 
      and still be well ahead the curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it could also be that in a decade or two we may be reading 
      articles like this one same way we do now for all those &quot;by 2000, 
      everyone has a personal rocket ship and eats food pills for lunch&quot; 
      future visions... we'll see. It's just that there are actual major 
      problems with current agricultural state of the sart; and I am not 
      thinking of left-wings &quot;agri-biz is bad&quot; angle, but rather more concrete 
      problems of us running out of phospates for fertilization (it is a 
      severely limited natural resource, turns out); loss/compaction of top 
      soil (may need no/low-tilling techniques; but current food crops are not 
      optimized for those); and the perennial problem of over-population and 
      continued world-wide population growth. Oh, and also rabid opposition by 
      well-meaning environmentalists against useful gene-manipulation and 
      breeding techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we shall see. We live in very interesting times. As always.

     <h3 class="entry-header">Good news is news too: thoughts on and by 3 quality nonline magazines</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      If I have said it once, I hope I have said it a thousands times. This is 
      a fact: americans are pampered by the big, affordable selection of 
      quality magazines. Or at least they should be spoiled if they do read 
      them -- I am still not yet convinced they do, after living in the states 
      for a decade. This abundance of goodness is in contrast to selection of 
      daily newspapers; which are -- relatively speaking -- not that much to 
      write home about. It's almost immoral how much good stuff you can 
      actually read from refined-tree-based non-daily print products, for a 
      very modest fee. My specific selection of such Great Magazines contains 
      three exemplars -- Scientific American, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/">Fortune</a> 
      and <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a> 
      -- but I suspect I could easily form many more such triplets and still 
      make similar statements. My choice of three is not limited my economics 
      or supply problems, but by time constraints: I can barely keep up with 
      these three, as things are.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I digress. After being inspired by one of many outstanding articles 
      (it'll be the last one I mention in this entry, so more on that one 
      later on), I thought it be fair to review one interesting and relevant 
      article from all three. So here's Tatu's October 2009 American Magazine 
      Article review.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. How American Auto-Industry was Put In Its Proper Place</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (aka &quot;The Auto Bailout: How We Did It&quot; by Fortune)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of articles chosen, this is the most close-to-earth one. It's a 
      condensed story of how GM/Chrysler cleanup project was done by the &quot;Team 
      Auto&quot; of the US government. It's easy reading, and outlines how well 
      difficult tasks can sometimes be managed, with combination of good 
      people, right timing and perhaps bit of luck. If you had asked me to 
      predict how well process could possibly succeed -- I mean, all the facts 
      were there, and odds did not look very good -- I think I would have 
      thought it unlikely that end result could be as good as it seems to be. 
      And this not so much based on the story, which mostly explains what was 
      done and how, but based on my thinking of how these things tend to go 
      (with the level of business acumen that a software engineer can possibly 
      possess, whether that's above or below average banker's talent).
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like Fortune for articles like this: it's not a dumbed down 
      version (there are weeklies that can dumb it down a notch; and then 
      newspaper that take it to almost imbecil level; and finally TV shows 
      that do the retard-a-versions for actual illiterates), but manages to be 
      very easy reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's not all: Fortune also manages to be a good magazine due to 
      its contrarian spirit. For a business magazine it has very independent 
      spirit, and viewpoints presented are varied and if possible even 
      something I'd call fair. It also tackles relevant and non-easy issues -- 
      it's not just yet another WSJ (which itself actually may be one of few 
      examples of good newspapers; nonetheless, it's much more predictable and 
      thus less interesting with respect to non-daily news; but I guess that's 
      only fair for a DAILY newspaper).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow: that's a good read, enough said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Living On a Razor's Edge (by National Geographic Magazine)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And just so as not to get too well grounded with day-to-day (or 
      year-to-year) living, it's good to mentally teleport into another time 
      and/or place. National Geographic offers multiple articles for doing 
      that; learning about other countries, cultures, flora and fauna, and all 
      combinations thereof. Picking something to showcase is not easy: 
      multiple articles could qualify.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all things being equal, reading about Madagascar is always a safe 
      bet for learning something new and unusual. But even within those 
      expectations, the story and especially pictures that illustrate it stand 
      far apart. I mean, how would one even imagine natural constructs like 
      these cathedral-spire lookalikes? And things that live and grow on, 
      around and under them. Whoa. Besides, it's somewhat of an uplifting 
      article too, for once human development is unlikely to directly threaten 
      the thing (indirectly climate change can of course affect it, perhaps 
      destory, but that's still better than gone-in-next-five-years odds many 
      other exotic places are given)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. The Rise of Vertical Farms (by Scientific American)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (see <a href="http://www.verticalfarm.com">http://www.verticalfarm.com</a> 
      for more)
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally this is the article that got me inspired to write about 
      stuff others write about. Article itself is sort of mind-blowing: the 
      idea of having skyscrapers used for growing our food sounds decidedly 
      futuristic, somewhat like the old (and for a while now, obsoleted) 
      future predictions of how everyone by 2000 flies around by a jet pack 
      and eats food pills for energy. But when you read the article and think 
      about it, the first questions should be &quot;would it really work?&quot;, &quot;why 
      didn't <b>*I*</b> think about it?&quot; and &quot;isn't that obvious now that I 
      read it?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      I like the creativity aspect of the idea; as well as its immense 
      fashionability. One of more surprising current undercurrents of 
      progressive (and I don't mean politically leftist label here) 
      forward-looking thinking is that agriculture is actually not a thing of 
      the past, declining &quot;industry&quot;, but something that is both very 
      essential for humankind and also something that is part of the future 
      and current, as well as past. The only thing that has been declining 
      wrt. farming has been amount of population it employs; but its 
      importance hasn't really reduced over time, nor will it significantly be 
      reduced any time soon. So although there has been steady pace of R&amp;D 
      over the years, it is only becoming obvious now that farming is a big 
      thing; there are lots of things wrong with it, but with all the 
      challenges there are also gigantic opportunities. This along with more 
      mundane trends of organic-food-is-cool, bundled with 
      finally-at-last-here american environmentalist awakening is really 
      making farming Cool with a capital C.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is where this idea becomes sizzling hot: hey, not only can you 
      produce fresh food locally (where are the consumers? in cities dummy!), 
      it can be both economically beneficial, good for your health (no, not in 
      the &quot;good vibes&quot; sense of organic food but with regards to actual 
      reduction of use of pesticides, less time for spoiling etc. etc. etc.), 
      AND good for environment (less land used, less water, can recycle waste 
      water and perhaps even solids; less energy for transportation). Oh yes, 
      and also good tasting due to freshness -- fresh produce year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Common Threads (or Exercise in Deep Thinking by an Amateur 
      Philosophist/-logist)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One more interesting thing about the &quot;Big Three&quot; is that they often 
      converge around similar topics, somewhat aligned thinking, same threads; 
      sometimes it might not be trivial to even know which magazine had any 
      given article if you weren't shown it. And I don't mean this in negative 
      way -- it's not that magazines are identical, or lack identity, but 
      rather that they are varied and topic selection thereby overlaps (but is 
      not lemming-like approach of daily news). Of course, some could call 
      such convergence zeitgeist; different entities talking about similar 
      things, threads that connect things that seem unrelated (like 
      environmentalist/naturalist NG vs. business-talk of Fortune vs Geeky 
      SciAm). And cynics would claim I am just missing weekly-paced 
      groupthink. Perhaps this is part of the thing -- there being thoughts 
      floating in time (as much as I hate the word, I guess I better use it... 
      memes).
    </p>
    <p>
      But I also think there's something related to sort of national way of 
      thinking (what is the word for that again? Volkgaist?). Beyond temporal 
      similarities (wars are more relevant when they are going on, obviously; 
      significance of most events is time-bound), there is this common 
      solution-oriented approach, and choosing of similarly current topics 
      (not just fashionable, as in discussing stupid crap like celebrity 
      gossip or politician's marital prolems) is something these magazines 
      share. And most importantly: there is always this underlying faith in 
      things improving over time. I suspect this is something profoundly 
      american; something more genuine than stomach-revoltingly-plastic 
      flag-waving variety of americana.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I mean is that many articles talk about how things could be 
      improved; it is actually quite rare to read an article where the overall 
      tone is negative, much less something where things are pointed out to be 
      hopeless. One could of course claim that's just good business sense (who 
      would pay to read about bad stuff), but that's easily rebuked: selling 
      social porn and doom-and-gloom is the business of TV networks, and quite 
      a profitable plan at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, enough soap-box philosophizing (is that a word? can make it one 
      if not?). Thank you for time. And please consider subscribing to some of 
      these great affordable american magazines, if you don't already. I'd 
      rather they be around during my lifetime, and maybe even my children. 
      There'll be more time to read when I retire. :-)

<div class="entry" id="post-309">
     <h3 class="entry-header">BAM Sandwich (Bacon, Avocado, Mayonnaise)</h3>
     
     <div class="entry-content">
          <div class="entry-body">
               <p><p>
      Many people are familiar with the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLT_sandwich">BLT 
      Sandwich</a>&quot; -- an acceptable if mediocre bread-based culinary 
      construct that mixes good stuff (Bacon) with acceptable (Tomato) and 
      trivial (Lettuce).
    </p>
    <p>
      But why settle for such a mediocre concoction? Shouldn't there be a 
      sandwich that focuses on essentials and provides more (ful)filling 
      eating experience? And complements a good drink of beer exquisitely?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Wham! BAM!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. There should. And -- more importantly -- there is!
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why I feel duty-bound to declare the invention of a new 
      sandwich: <b>Bacon-Avocado-Mayonnaise Sandwich,</b> henceworth known as 
      the &quot;<b><i>BAM Sandwich</i></b>&quot;. It not only tastes awesomer-er 
      than a can of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawndo">Brawn-do</a>, 
      but also sounds kick-ass.<br>(... and it's got the elecrolytes your 
      muscles crave!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2. How?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how you can construct a tasty instance of<b><i> (Tatu's 
      World-Famous) BAM Sandwich</i></b>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fry the bacon on a frying pan or skillet; move to side once crisp (can 
        rest on a paper towel). NOTE: Do NOT throw away the melted tasty fat! 
        (see step 3).
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the avocado spread; use ripe avocados, mix with bit of lemon 
        juice, salt, pepper (white or black) or tabasco, and optionally some 
        sour cream. Result is essentially something between mashed avocado and 
        guacamole, depending on your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry 2 slices of toast (regular cheap-o sliced bread; or, for bonus 
        points, olive-oil-rosemary or potato bread) using the bacon fat from 
        step 1; preferably use the same frying pan or skillet as you used for 
        frying bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Construct the sandwich:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with one fried slice of bread
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread some Avocado spread on the slice
          </li>
          <li>
            Stack (as much) bacon (as you want) on top of avocado spread
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread some mayonnaise on the other slice
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the other slice on top of bacon, mayonnaise side facing bacon
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once properly constructed, enjoy with a good glass of your favorite 
      beverage; like a frothy pint of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer">Hefeweizen</a> 
      such as Blue Moon (lighter beers seem to go better with somewhat dense 
      food like BAMwich!).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Random helpful preparation notes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some additional notes on preparing a Good Solid BAM:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bacon must absolutely be fried fully crisp. Floppy bacon does not a 
        proper BAM sandwich make!
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use as many bacon strips per sandwich as you want, but minimum 
        is 3 strips for an adult male. For ladies, the legal minimum limit is 
        2. Small kids are not allowed to touch this tasty treat (ours do not 
        even like it! Those ungrateful little...) -- in fact, a rule of thumb 
        is that if you can't drink the accompanying beer, you are not to eat 
        the sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you absolutely must (by direct doctor's order, for example) reduce 
        your saturated fat intake, you can be given exemption from having to 
        fry the toast: regular toasting can be accepted as a low-fat 
        alternative. But note: if you do this for anything but 
        life-threatening medical reasons, you will totally lose your man-food 
        street cred and run the risk of growing pair of bunny ears.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to share your additional tips, in form of comments, backtracks 
      or emails (heck, even clicking on an ad you can see near this entry 
      counts as a useful additional tip! Har har, I'll be here all week, thank 
      you very many!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Musings on Food Terminology and Coining of new Phrases</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to high degree of compatibility between BAM and optimal male diet &amp; 
      taste, I think this soon-to-be classic sandwich can be called a manwich, 
      if there is such a word. And if there is no such word yet, there will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5. Unhelpful side note</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been brought to my attention that someone has previously tried to 
      tie acronym &quot;BAM&quot; with sequence of words &quot;Bacon, Arugula and Mango&quot;. 
      Yuck. If there is any justice in the universe, person responsible for 
      such disgrace is forced to eat his or her own dog food, in substantial 
      quantities.<br>And with no Blue Moon to wash it down with.
    </p>
    <p>

      Some of you may have heard of my last beer-related project, <i>BlackBerryBeer 
      2008</i>. Due to unfortunate logistical problems (aka my laziness), the 
      project failed. Year changing to 2009, making project name obsolete, did 
      not help either. In fact, the project failed bad enough so that it is 
      one of very very few projects I don't even list on my Monster resume.

        It is necessary to pick the blackberries before snow falls: failure to 
        do so will make succesful completion impractical, perhaps even 
        impossible. (sidenote: this was <b>the</b> fatal blow to B3 2008! 
        Triple Boo for snow!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Figuring out details like who to use for actual manufacturing (and at 
        what cost) is important. Turns out these things don't just magically 
        sort themselves out (Double Boo for things that don't take care of 
        themselves)
      </li>
      <li>
        Concrete plan is needed for storing resulting half a cask of 
        custom-crafted beer -- our fridge can not contain more than maybe a 
        dozen sixpacks, which is less than half a cask. It was pointed out 
        that it is possible to alleviate this problem a little by drinking 
        more beers faster; and that fortunately our home has multiple 
        bathrooms to help with resulting logistics problem of excreting excess 
        urinary liquids

        Blackbery bushes have nasty thorns; and resulting bruises heal slowly

      On positive note, it was also determined that these problems will be 
      overcome with this next-generation project. After all, the stakeholders 
      are now exceedingly thirsty; the blackberry season is not yet over in 
      the grand state of Washington; and all the itchy blackberry wounds have 
      been fully healed by now (in fact, some new ones have been gained to 
      further the goal picking the dang berries; further strengthening our 
      resolve for succesful outcome!)

      One good thing about having a failed project is that usually you can 
      reuse much of planning material; generally goals are reusable, sometimes 
      even secondary artifacts like resourcing and scheduling.<br>This is the 
      case here: goals have not changed a bit. We still want to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li resolver="NamedStyle:default {font-family=Tahoma,font-size=3,font-weight=normal,FONT_ATTRIBUTE_KEY=javax.swing.plaf.FontUIResource[family=Dialog,name=Tahoma,style=plain,size=11],name=default,font-style=,}" margin-top="0">
        Produce a batch of unique beer using some local ingredients (this is 
        where Blackberries come into picture: after all, the only other 
        plentiful local resource -- rain -- is not a particularly recognizable 
        ingredient in the end)
      </li>
      <li>
        Without having to handle the brewing part (as students we did this 
        part -- it's fun, but only first couple of times; and we are well 
        beyond that!)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We are confident that these goals will be met by the project; similar to 
      how we were confident last year (turns out that optimism is, too,

        Pick the berries (use of child labor approved, maybe even encouraged

      Apologies for not having a flashy Flash version of the plan. If you want 
      to see a flashier plan, try drinking enough vodka to make the list above 
      spin and bounce on your computer screen (hint: wear 3D glasses for extra 
      fun!)

      <b>Current State of the Project: Green (with Slight Chance of Yellow?)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      So: although total collected blackberry harvest is still somewhat below 
      required level (dang -- we also need to figure out what that level is!), 
      we are confident that the end result will be enjoyable to drink, and 
      going to be such enjoyed during year of 2009.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more positive lack of development: we still haven't run across a 
      single bottle of blackberry beer (although there are some <a href="http://beernews.org/2008/10/samuel-adams-blackberry-witbier-wins-chocolate-bock-longshot-updates/">Wild 
      Internet Rumors</a> that hint at possibility of future sightings). This 
      is different from many other flavors of fruit beer: our project team has 
      already field-tested multiple brands of blueberry beer, at least one 
      tasty brand of strawberry beer (hi there Strawberry Blonde! Call me!); 
      and of course the always-good Pyramid Apricot Ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok ok ok. That's a so-called rhetorical question. You can stop listing 
      suggestions now (&quot;I find your lack of faith disturbing!&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Post Scriptum</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a decent batch of B3 is ready (in 2 months? Just in time for 
      Thanksgiving!), volunteer beer drinkers may be needed. Our project team 
      is thirsty, but even our bladders have limits. More info will be 
      forthcoming if and when reinforcements are needed.
